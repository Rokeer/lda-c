like checking crops reacting sending messages people like solider needs help calls army 
maybe warn people earth earth going sucked black hole 
things like help people earth understand space exploration great 
articles believe continue funding space exploration 
reasons fund 
reasons fund convinced 
reason fund space exploration americans lived poverty 
saying funding space exploration support americans need 
true space exploration funding billion dollars anually budgets like funding national defense billion dollars annually 
national defense funding higher space exploration funding 
think lower budget national defense money support americans instead taking away funding space exploration 
reason fund space exploration people world suffer diseases easily prevented 
example numerous africans year malaria caused mosquito bites 
prevention disease africans afford 
saying funding space exploration prevent spread diseases easily avoided 
true space exploration improved medicine prevent people receiving 
instance launch nasa developed medical instruments helped doctors learn human body reaction stress 
amazing discoveries space explorations helped people people suffer 
countless good reasons fund space exploration 
continue space exploration develop sophisticated ideas continue prosper believe continue fund space exploration 
fund space exploration things government spend money government spends billion dollars national defense billion dollars education 
spend billion dollars space exploration 
huge money compared 
space exploration benefits like nasa track astronauts health stressful conditions 
developed tool helped doctors understand human body reaction stress 
nasa scientist ideas better exercise machines better airplanes easier tell weather

improve produce distribute food 
helps solve problems earth 
space exploration helps creative urging better technology better scientific knowledge 
time inspire reality 
benefit competetion nations 
human suffering avoided compete space exploration spaceships instead airplanes drop bombs 
like cold 
support space exploration 
better reasons supporting space exploration 
austronauts know money invested rocket 
people debate wether space exploration desirable money pollution poverty americans live 
article importance space exploration convince space exploration desirable 
giving reasons convince 
money invested rocket 
amout money invested billion dollars 
year 
people struggle bills expensive 
secondly million people america lives poverty 
people need food water shelter medical attention expensive 
africa people diseas called malaria spread mosquitos deaths prevented buying costs dollars people africa afford 
lastly pollution 
rocket launched burns 
pollution affects farmland gives food 
affect ocean kill fish 
people austronauts cool space 
wort deaths poverty pollution 
want wort death 
reading article believe space exploration desirable needs earth 
example 46.2 million americans live poverty 
spend money space exploration improve lives people 
program develop clean energy viewed worthy investment clean non-pollutionary energy world sorely needs 
means spend money resources space exploration able energy need 
problem people countries dying uneccessarily access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
invest space exploration thoroughly able prevent deaths 
conclusion believe space exploration desirable needs earth 
think waste money space exploration important humans 
scientist astronauts space happen earth future 
maybe earth going gone foever people prepare 
astronauts scientist study space 
government money heal people fine people fewer earth 
people favor space exploration argue billion 
people space explore planet live like earth 
earth gone people earth travel live 
astronauts hurt exploration space 
doctors study astronauts hurt space exploration 
nasa scientists developed innovations improved lives 
include better exercise machines better planes better weather forecasting 
scientists helped improve machines travel earth humans hurt 
study space machines luanch polluted earth rockets 
maybe machine space scientists need travel look machine control machine 
people think money spent instead help heal people earth

reason discouraging space exploration earth suffering 
earth suffering fossil fuels cars heat airplanes trains buses 
fossil fuels include gasoline fossil fuels harms breathe plants absorb gives oxegen harm/kill animals 
stop fund little stop proverty harmful fossil fuel instead space exploration 
final reason encouraging space exploration thoose inventions nasa 
thoose inventions help astronauts survive/stay space

medical instruments doctors help patients stress cure 
space exploration improve people lives better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forcasts 
space exploration motivates nation compete benefical competitions like cold russia competed land moon 
achieved human suffering avoided friendly race moon instead bomb dropping planes 
space exploration uses money help improve lives 
fertile soil help grow food tracking weathers 
help medical fields stress patients 
importantly helps countries avoid wars kill hurt people benefical compitition 
america people dying diseases spreaded like malaria spreaded mosquitos 
people having problems getting shelter food medicine familys stay healthy provent diseases kill 
people having hard time paying rent apartment morgage house live homeless 
polution atmosphere making people animal sickness

exploring space instead help solve problems hurting people 
change 
thanks authors text evidence helped realize actually important continue space exploring 
funding space exploration think continue fund space exploration 
continue fund benefits space exploration 
example cost funds like military 
help advance medicine education technology 
funding space exploration solve problems like finding people need help weather crops dong 
help people creative stop people fighting want explore space 
example cold happening russia competing land moon article says cold warm united states russia competed 
prove greatness race explore space 
century later people wonder space 
know government banned space exploration 
people claim money space world worth discovering 
support 
fund space exploration 
billion dollars 
thats costs fund actually 
national budget 
u.s.a spends billion national defense billion education 
think 
nasa scientists discovered innovations studying astronauts space 
example better exercise machines airplanes 
scientists checked astronaut health learned human reaction stress 
space exploration challenge 
motivate scientists astronauts goals motivate scientists astronauts goals 
1900 u.s.a russia competed land spaces craft moon 
goal nations acheived 
people money spent space exploreation instead help live poverty hungry 
great satellites circle earth monitor land 
hunger measure condition rainforest crops plants droughts 
people distrubute food need 
space exploration cost influence innovations challenge helps people hungry live poverty 
fund space exploration pain losing money gaining discoveries 
think wase money space exploration 
46.2 million americans live poverty money wase space help people dying 
malaria world money wase space exploration nets protect people bitten sleep

convinced 
article says government spends billion dollars year space exploration 
later article says total national budget 
tells government money space exploration compared 
argument improve people lives true says article developed technologies nasa engineers developed space travel possible technology help people 
reason author convinced space exploration desirable needs people earth stop wars space exploration motivate beneficial competition nations focus wars instead space exploration 
article importance space exploration fact convince space exploration justified 
despite present issues earth think space exploration limited 
strongly consider motivation venturing space supplies nation major factor promoting space exploration 
landed moon july 1969 young kids inspired astronauts 
time scientist astronaut desirable occupation 
motivation field science math lead knowledge area 
addition watching neil armstrong land moon brought sense nationalism country desirable feeling 
second argue space exploration unnecessary cruel live lost earth 
eisenhower said rocket fired theft citizens suffering hunger poverty 
issues need addressed reason hold capable 
inventions following space exploration beneficial fixing issues 
example medical advancements space exploration correlation stress body conditions greatly improve life earth 
adition teflon velcro inventions including accurate weather forecasts result space exploration 
lastly believe cutting funding nasa space exploration billion dollars correct place money issues earth 
edible national budget goes prison death penalty 
deplete money worth cause obviously benefits life earth time fund blocs governments waste money 
sense national pride motivation accelerating math science fields beneficial discoveries inventions uneccessary budget cuts convince space exploration continue despite problems earth faces 
disagree author money space things happening world like poverty people going hungry/ starving people countries dying diseases spread mosquitos 
medicine need help survive money 
spend billion trying moon looks like close trying figure 46.2 million americans thats people live america live poverty 
people earth gasoline gets 
scientist need greener power cars homes factories 
people exploring earth priority needs world 
people think going space harmful compare billion dollars spend education 
billion dollars americans spend education going useful money kids countries dont books paper pencils 
places kids share book 
topic people going space scientist moniter astronuts health stressful conditions 
moniter happens space happens earth thier alot stressful things happening world right 
conclude essay think people need stop worrying whats happening space start worrying problems world 
think people money nasa military like passage said nets people infected dont 
health city money places afford things like dont clean water clean 
americans live poverty money poor 
start planning living mars earth isnt clean 
money going military 
army weaker start wars lose/ know going space inventions better scientists money poor 
saying people live space like saying people live underwater 
said live mars trying trick people things space watch earth agree dont live mars 
think alot people talk 
fund space exploration costs money 
government spent billion dollars year space exploration 
think money spent useful help heal people earth 
people argue billion dollars 
like said government spent billion dollars year space exploration 
government spending money space exploration suffering paying housing food medicine 
access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
think money spent useful africa disease called malaria kills people mosquito bites 
people affected malaria afford large nets protect bitten sleep 
people argue billion dollars

thats think money space exploration spent space exploration medicine poor countries 
fund space exploration spite problems earth 
cons pros 
funding space exploration expensive lead advancements medicine technology help resolve hunger poverty conflicts earth 
compared amounts money spend military education renewable energy money spent space exploration miniscule 
national budget scathing compared billion dollars 26.3 national budget spend military 
space exploration lead technological medical advancements 
according nasa scientists monitor astronauts health stressful conditions 
result medical instruments developed 
improvements exercise machines airplanes weather forecasting thanks space exploration 
problems earth need solve poverty 
space exploration actually help resolve problems draw attention away 
example satellites launched space monitor plots land 
relay valuable information growth crops 
lead improvements produce distribute food effectively helping people earth fight hunger easier 
space exploration push aside help people earth improve lives 
space exploration reap tangible benefits technological medical advancements reap emotional rewards 
look resolve inspiration achievements space travel like landed moon spark kind determination feeling proudness 
help improve life earth fund space exploration 
people debating spend valuble money problems like hunger going space 
believe going space improve technology 
problems earth 
think solve problems moving 
world hunger poverty huge problem earth 
people afford housing food medical care 
countries people dying 
afford food clean water stay healthy 
people afford health care 
example people africa year malaria 
improved buying inexpensive mosquito people afford 
medicines hard expensive 
lastly space money spent better uses renewable energy 
fossil fuels destroying earth 
money easily spent finding renewable energy 
money better things 
problems earth ones 
money spent space prevent world hunger sickness pollution 
exploring space priority solved ones ground 
think space exploration reasons 
money people poverty 
people need cure disise like malaria aford nets 
space ship creates polution damages breath creates yuky 
discusing reazon 46.2 milion americans dont houses monet families known poverty 
nasa people waste billion space program homeless 
space probably fail fell feel happy homeless money 
discusing reason people africa dying sufering dying 
space program want prevent moskito bite space ship prevent deat provoke death poluting putting fish migt relies fish 
dead 
discusing reason afects peoples life spaceship aleak explode pices migt come flying kill sevear ingury near ouch migt hurt alot knockt money went trash 
instad giving poor 
hard finel state ment space exploration 
space travel provides tangible benefits continued funded 
people think billion dollars allot

article says uses nations budget 
large budget money 
money places poverty people dying starvation unable purchase neccesary medicine survive 
money schools year books thats contents completely outdated irrelevent 
article mention useful medical research stress 
need test astronaught stress 
unbelievable stress world tested minimal funds 
saying helps medicine meerly excuse 
want test people highly stressful situations test single mother children lost 
stress 
hearing blast launch space 
talks improved machines airlines scientists engineers focusing time machines airplanes

lots people need money public schools better books equipment teachers able teach students things fullest 
right schools need money fund stuff believe money type reasons 
pollution causes earth lots harm right improve earth pollution 
burgs melting making ocean level rise higher higher 
cause holes ozone layer protects harmful rays 
sadly pollution gases cauing ozone layer harm continues situation 
better focus money problems like space 
reason medical sevices 
everyday gets injury money needed things equipment need 
compare going space important believe better focus earth improve problems worry space later 
reasons important fundings space exploration especially problem cause earth people lives earth diffcultie 
problems like poverty education pollution medical services delt comparison going space important 
question 
space exploration things earth 
earth choice home live 
think stop funding money space exploration earth 
evidence text 
need help earth polution cars types building 
start eco-nomic friendly enviorment like start making cars alot uses electricity maybe cars food vegetable 
second help people need like medicine 
money states countries help people prevent sickness like malaria mosquito type disease spreads people lifes risks 
help people education learning read write 
money supplies materials schools need 
teachers wont worry worry 
past years teachers pretty worry getting pink slips means pretty 
money 
worry 
space funding author convince space exploration desirable 
needs earth space important 
billion year bout years 
billion wasted space exploration 
imagine people helped billion dollars 
46.2 americans living poverty difficulties paying housing food medicine 
people rare diseases sicknesses everyday billion dollars spent finding ways cure dieases sicknesses 
money help countries poverty like africa 
people malaria year hair cost prevent disease definitely worth 
burning fossil fuels causes pollution harming environment oceans

help tell important information need 
billion dollars compared government buys 
space exploration gives technology need everyday lives 
solve questions unknown mankind 
facts know exists 
think money poor 
people africa suffering 
getting clean water diseases 
like malaria disease mosquito bites leaves virus kills people africa 
stop hanging giant nets sleep 
costs people infected afford 
reason afford nets poverty 
need feed family home 
sleep streets 
starve food 
sleeping streets 
bigger chance getting malaria 
hurting people hurting environment 
burning fossil fuels 
causing pollution 
forms cleaner energy cars homes factories 
maybe space exploration prioty 
people starving suffring diseases 
need space exploration 
believe type exploration necessary feed curiosity race 
people demolished known limits impossible happen 
people wasting money space travel reality national budget 
opposers money help people earth exploration beneficial people dealing poverty problems 
satellites send detect weather patterns 
space travel brought ideas table created inventions 
form medicine nasa learned body reacts stress training 
brought created ideas better exercise machines airplanes 
opportunity space travel opened doors nation 
created field curiosity 
accomplished things dream trying 
brought information world pushed limits 
country 
known curiosity willingness attain information 
space people want learn chances

conclude space people wondered dreamt years years chance explore 
time exploration regretted future 
maybe mysteries space holds help earth 
think going space good idea 
author convinced going space cost 
discover worlds/planets 
budget spending right 
problems solved exploring space 
hunger poverty solved 
satellites orbiting earth monitor tons land 
track measure condition crops rainfall drought etc.the author says 
data improve people produce distribute food 
nasa developed inventions helped humans 
inventions better exercise machines better planes better weather forecasting 
engineering space travel better inventions 
finally space exploration helped area medicine 
astronauts went outer space scientists figure monitor health stressful conditions 
figuring medical instruments discovered help doctors understand people react stress 
conclusion think space exploration good idea

46.2 million americans 
live poverty 
like example people live street people live house 
people dieing place stay 
article reasons nasa funding nasa funding 
funding better benefit 
opnion think funding plethora reasons 
arguments space exploration stem belief money spent differently-to improve people lives 
people suffering poverty having family care cases people care selves 
space people dying earth 
diseases spreading poverty areas 
example malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
instead sending people space investing nonsense cure diseases save people 
supplies people 
lastly gasoline kill earth polluted 
instead sending people space help save earth 
programs help clean earth 
program develop clean energy viewed worthy investment conclusion think send people space waste money 
money people diseases people poverty develop programs clean earth 
things help things earth 
author convinced support space exploring 
reasons 
exploring space medicine healthy fight sickness 
second doctor human react stress stressful 
help better airplanes prevent airplane crash loss airplane control 
finally fourth track measure condition crops rainfall soil 
information improve growth crops 
actually exploring space help people earth 
continue space exploring maybe invent useful things people knowledge space 
article states space exploration needs earth 
feel like 
need space exploration 
space wonderful place 
explorations nasa track asteroids going fast travel explorations wouldnt know looks like planets 
nasa allowed scientists missions ways monitor health stress 
help earth 
ways protect earth 
start planting trees instead cutting 
help save animals example sharks people fins throw water need help start serving fresh foods 
space explorations needs time 
work think right path change world better place 
disagree spend money space exploration people different countries need money survive 
helping people better space exploration need money space ready lots space exploration 
nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine point lives 46.7 million americans live poverty 
countries people dying access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
example malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills spread disease hanging large nets beds protect people bitten sleep 
earth suffering 
scientists believe pollution burning fossil fuels gasoline harming oceans 
need cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
maybe exploring space priority needs earth 
government spends billion dollars year space exploration 
people think money spent instead help heal people earth 
spend money people need 
belive space exploration conntinu help fockes fist person moon ensted bomb dropping airplanes 
helpd stop cold 1960 united states russia fist ones space planets 
think problems earth like americans live poverty shortig water food illegible medical care 
africa pepol ding becase meleria illegible help poting nets ther beds 
think space exploration helps pepol making betere medicine monitor health stress machines help monitor wether crops airplanes wether forecasting 
problems hunger poverty solved space exploration 
satellite circle earth monitor lots land trac illegible crops soil rainfall 
helps contane nolege mathe schince 
stop space thing spending hella money instead making homes home fixing streets sumthing like 
sould space travel becas lots benifits space travel 
like doesnt money space travel like persent money goverment gives money things barly diffrence 
space travel inproves lots things like maid better exersis mushins 
know good people work ther stress maid better aire plains 
trave poverty sickness takeled becase learn medicsin wail space travel 
sould space travel 
think exploring space like like 
people supprised 
peoples dream come true space like bfvsgf 
think people given chance want stopped people exploring space people 
space exploration important motivate beneficial competition amoung nations 
exploring space benefit things 
space exploration help remain creative society 
creative makes better society enjoy 
shows looking outward space improved life earth 
looking space great time happy eaven happier 
exploring space life changing remember great period time 
happyness spread 
space exploration funded help sick homeless 
people think space exploration waste money spend people need help 
people think funding space exploration believe satelites circle earth monitor land time 
track measure crops soil rainfall drought 
improve produce distribute food 
example spend milions dollars spaceships help people africa need nets 
need nets lots mosquitos spread disease called malaria 
hanging nets beds protected dont mosquito malaria 
spend money space explorations 
spend national budget billion dollars 
money thousands nets food medication 
billion dollars actually 
money provide things like shelter clean water medical care 
46.2 milion people live poverty 
afford cheap nets 
space exploration expensive earth 
scientists said burn lots fossil fuel 
fossil fuel gasoline 
fossil fuel harms ocean humans inhale near 
need cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
program develop clean energy good worthy investment 
opinion think spend money people poverty 
space exploration interesting think save people dying 
money humans world save 
space exploration help solve human problems spending billion dollars better send space return 
believe space exploration needed solve problems help 
heles creative society 
reasons feel strive better technologies scientific knowledge 
inspires innovative work 
lets machines better planes better weather forecast 
opponent waste money things money 
like healing people world 
feel wrong things help creative society 
plus earth billion dollars national budget 
space exploration instead having 
help 
space exploration allows closer truth space science 
space exploration waste money price learn universe 
thing learn space contribute refer things like work space 
gone space learned gravity known planets existed 
space exploration successful things history learning stop 
learn 
nasa scientists great improvements lives today 
contain better forecasts better exercise machines form things space 
nasa space exploration track places earth farmers need need vegetation land grow crops 
people know space exploration benefit society agreed 
continue space exploration 
continue exploring space 
opinion think able know happening outside world 
passage nasa alot good uses improve world 
money space research lower funding schools nation defense 
people disagree funding space exploration money 
countries bomb cost space scientists planet exploring spaceship save money 
remember science teacher telling world generation 
scientist live planets great 
space exploration gets stopped 
regret 
space exploration good funding project improved working machines airplanes weather forecasts 
improvement able feel safe 
agree continuing space exploration 
agree great 
regret 
think space exploration necessary actually uses gases fuels waste money 
honest 50/50 space exploration reasons 
think according article space explorations good idea reasons 
reason fair u.s. takes money people space africa suffers money curtain treatment medicine cure deseases spread 
africa 
reason nasa spends billion dollars 
people space single travel kind money directly hungry homeless poor people africa money treated properly desease 
reason possibly astronauts claustrophobic sort special medication possibly kind weather conditions sick worse 
types risks going outer space 
positive things space exploration people persuing dreams inspire people think memorable 
reason space exploration great scientists scientists observe earth space hours 
record data space earth observe 
believe waste money space exploration money people need life people sickness people suffering money people 
cure save 
reasons malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
reason scientist believe pollution burning fossil fuels gasoline harming oceans 
opponents think space exploration important motivate opponent think space exploration help remain creative society motivation bring best 
feel wrong people sick malaria help sickness 
help money help save kids lives people space exploration helpful people 
help people sickness 
o'neill7_020034463 america people dying diseases spreaded like malaria spreaded mosquitos 
people having problems getting shelter food madicine familys stay healthy provent diseases kill 
people having hard time paying rent apartment morguge house live homeless 
polution atmosphere making people animal sickness 
people animals able fresh breath fresh clean water drink fish dying polution water 
spreading probably bears 
dieseased fish lakes streams come 
bears probably diseases fish spread 
fund space exploration making want better technology knowledge space 
stop nations space exploring rockets destructive planes space races improve education america

example people treatment common flu-to extreme disease 
money space save millions lives 
space know 
sattilites things space 
need study space anymore know 
desirable space said knowledge space help people proverty 
people provet sheter food medical treatment things needs like stoping pulltion 
example earth liveable space ships fite people sick 
space exploration idea good idea 
stick space exploration space exploration 
space exploration good evidence support 
'before nasa allowed astronauts missions scientists ways monitor health stressful conditions

finally cause compitition nations 
better build spaceships compitition building bombs 
example cold 1960 
russia race land space craft moon 
growth america education especially math science 
importance space exploration controversy spending million dollars space people earth suffering 
essay deal sides believe sides 
example budget space exploration thats 
46.2 million people living poverty america 
space exploration help earth tracking rops growth weather tamin 
piece evidence says article track measure conditions crops soil rainfall drought etc..it help people know grow crops 
hand peoples earth poverty 
evidence 46.2 million americans live poverty 
million think 
says neerly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine point lifes 
million people living america means million people problem 
time space exploration helps billion people living planet earth 
conclusion mixed feelings think helping poor priority 
space exploration fund billion dollars government 
money everybody explore space government spend billion national defense 26.3 national budget billion education budget billion renewable energy 
people suffer space exploration funded government needs thing time 
heal people earth left earth remain ghost planet

space exploration waste money cause people poverty hunger 
money space exploration help environment 
space interesting worth 
agree author money held importance economy 
lowered taxes homeless dropout rate decrease people poverty 
true space exploration concluded great inventions concluded people homes people difficulty rent 
earth important life 
money helping earth example houces people living troubles bills solar energy houses 
rockets hurt earth fossil energy 
fossils burned energy poulotion polutes breathe witch sick hurt bodys 
speaking sickness money help cures diseases malaria cancer 
people diseases effect future relationships familys friends 
malaria caused insects like misqutios blocked nets 
nets costs aford economy cash problems 
president eisenhower 1953 agrees 
money hurt earth instead help earth ways 
concludes opinion matter money help mankind kill 
imagine world happy families friends living peacefully single drop polution harms 
reasons continue finding space explarations 
intresting people like explore space dont care wehthr expensive money school supplies homeless people rehab 
care money going people live streets dying food money money waste drugs 
believe nasa stop sending people space 
people chose career nasa 
explore space needs earth 
answer 
army reason 
know answer 
think explore space people streets trying live good life rich people space time lives 
mean 
reasons explore space 
second people group space expect easy ride destination 
dangerous people hurt error process 
meteor cosmic 
second reason 
finally takes billion dollars year space exploration 
money provide medical research sick provide homes shelthers homeless people animals 
money environment getting destroyed 
final reason 
conclusion space exploration money kept different sources world 
need care earth care planet want plant earth needs takeing care need trees need thing space 
time space lots years need food home stuff space 
need earth firs plant trees space good 
military care puts military proverts community 
donate helps planes solarsystem 
think help getting suffering 
makes cares homes factorys ecofrendly 
want stop poverty suffering 
benefits earth 
disagree author earth important 
instead wasting billion dollars space exploration medicans people help need 
money finding instead burning fossils fuels gasoline oils 
people need help stop malaria spreading 
half americans need nets cost stop malaria spreading 
year africa people gets killed malaria 
cars homes factorys destroys earth everyday 
people money form energy help earth harming oceans 
article says scientists believe pollution burning fossils fuels gasolines oils harming oceans 
quote article says program develop clean energy viewed worthy investment 
continue space exploration pollution disease 
think space exploration needed need like living beings earth 
helps danger like asteroid heading earth 
reason satellites monitor earth rainfall good times plant crops 
doctors learn human body reaction stress 
space exploration advanced technology technology improved lives 
space exploration beneficial source knowlege funded 
beneficial brought increases knowlge math science inventions improvement selfesteam/motivation 
folowing paragraphs touch subject convince reader space exploration worthy funding 
main argument space exploration government focus education 
education funding people want complain pointless funding attaking millitary defence 
secondly past increases knowlge math science rocket engineering math formulas 
unlike argument giving billion dollars spent education contributing education going funding main arguments funding humans 
focus earth 
exploring planets testing rockets space shuttles making inventions human race inovating ideas creating inventions like satilites warning huricane coming days hits saving countless lives 
finally improves self esteam motivation individual country 
people feel sense pride seeing country humans sending space explore horizons chip away uncharted space 
self esteam healthy pull country depration good spirt 
space exploration funded dose good harm 
benifits presents indepth knowlge math science inventions increase self esteam 
reader convinced funding benifitial worth 
definitly continue continue space exploration need know space 
totally agree author 
space exploration important people money space going like donation cleaning earth education 
wonder outside earth 
moon planets 
know 
think living space planets 
alien 
right 
alot people scientists said sign living thing outside earth 
mean exist 
brain mean 
aliens going attack earth defeat 
stuff alot upgraded 
maybe know aliens exist well..not 
alot things space 
know humans live forever animals 
maybe earth going 
garbage earth maybe theis reason know 
return money 
space explorations uses total budget 
people africa needed help 
malaria disease spreads mosiquito cost protect bitting durning night 
maybe help looking medical treatment space help 
need time 
knows space 
making rockets improve people better technich airplanes spaceships 
people different opinions space exploration 
good thing think opposite 
humans think space exploration terrible thing 
example government spends billion dollars year space exploration 
money spent space possibly helping bunch people better lives 
hard people things people clean water drink 
imagine difference world government uses money help people 
space exploration bright

said 'the rocket fired theft citizens suffered hunger poverty 
auther convince think earth need space exploration disease spread killed people 
people live earth stop giving money space exploration focus problem earth 
example spending money thing like helping cure prevent disises stop poverty thing clean enery 
example 46.2 million americans live poverty 
half americans difficulty paying housing food medical care 
countries like africa people dying access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent diseases 
example disease affected people world especialy africa malaria disiase 
disiase easily prevented hanging nets beds people africa afford 
considered example extreme poverty people africa nets cost dollars 
earth suffering actions 
time people earth started burning fossil fuels gasoline started rising 
affacted earth apsorbs rays mean galciere north south pole mealting quicker usual 
effect rising level warmer temperatures 
people spend money better thing like helping sciantist create clean energy factories thing arent 
reasons people spend billion dollars space explorations start focusing real problems earth 
reasons beileve space needs earth starters protect earths valueable resources 
water ground animals

author convinced space exploration desirable 
desirable technology advantages 
means actually learn space exploration 
space exploration better techniques things 
better ideas strategies 
math science skills advance also-space exploration actually help money think opportunities better carreer teaches math science 
earth people discovered things space 
paying space equipment vechicles lead people proverty lack food water 
people need money better cars airplanes technologies houses 
people suffering death dirty water medical care diseases 
plus satellites space equipment monitor space 
nasa money space exploration instead things need earth 
think earth explore space 
space exploration think government spend billion dollars space exploration 
things need money earth 
46.2 million americans live poverty 
billion dollars build houses grow food clothes poor 
help hospitals places like africa tons people malaria/ billion dollars stop malaria killing people buying mosquito nets 
believe earth needs help 
need money start clean energy stop pollution

wanted land moon explore planets 
resulted tons technologies progress america education 
space exploration satillites measure conditions crops track measure rainfall 
help diminish poverty helping distribute food better 
nasa invented better medical instruments excersize machines airplanes 
believe need spend billion dollars space exploration 
need money clean energy help earth help stop poverty illnesses 
biased opinion funding space exploration billion dollars 2.6-2.7 trillion dollar budget government 
education funding billion dollar mark roughtly times funding space exploration 
space exploration help world ecosystem starving cost billion dollars education budget roughly billion dollars 
considering school lunches employees electricity bills waterbills school cost couple million dollars anually students text books periods price roughly 
250*x-amount students middle school 
adding costs nation unfair students like funding compared prison cost education funding support space exploration funding 
space vast open area 
like debate people having worth

believe spend money important things earth 
like said article nearly half americans struggle paying housing food medicine point lives 
countries people dying access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
people africa malaria disease spread mosquito bites 
possible lower chance people getting malaria buying mosquitos 
cost dollars people infected malaria cannnot afford 
spend money space human 
know great causes came spending money chance fact people struggling live decent country 
stick money things important 
maybe world actually turn better place 
thank 
fund space exploration helps bring best ourselfs 
earth 
know want space kinda know happen 
like earth 
whant 
think space cool beautiful things 
reading article space exploration desirable reasons 
example paragraph 'tangible benifits space exploration 'people favor space exploration argue billion dollars 
important space exploration money wasted like national defense billion dollars billion dollars wasted education 
article states 'nasa scientists devoloped innovations improved lives 
innovations include better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
important cause improve lives humans stay healthy 
quote article 'even problems hunger poverty tackled space exploration 
example satellites track measure conditions crops soil rainfall drought 
finally article pants 'beyond providing wiht inventions space exploration important challenge provides motivation bring best 
important create technology scientific knowledge 
reasons space exploration desirable 
space exploration needed needed 
author covinced space exploration makes planes safer need safer planes billion school hospitals things help people 
reasons need space explration satilite space explration know rain 
safer planes like 1919 'the cold bomd troping planes 
national budget 
reasons space explartion waste billion dollar space need earth like helping school supplies school 
help build shelters homeless families 
think space exploration funded 
problems earth think money 
space exploration lead benefits 
example nasa allowed astronauts missions scientists ways monitor health stressful conditions 
benefits think space exploration desirable needs earth 
instead funding space exploration money need 
people dying access clean water medical care prevent spreading disease 
money help ones need 
space exploration good idea developed innovations improved lives 
believe peoples lives number priority 
problems fixed space exploration funded improve things 
article space exploration countined funded america 
stance space exploration countined funded reasons 
reason space exploration stay doesnt cost national budget compared national defense budget 26.3 education 
space exploration doesnt cost alot compared 
maybe instead focus budget 
second reason space exploration stay brings best making strive improve things happen 
space exploration makes better overall waste money 
space exploration makes progress skills know improving 
final reason space exploration stay motivates competition nations build spaceships instead stuff 
causes human suffering space exploration 
advances 
care determine decsions money/care goes 
care decsions people like 
care good decisions 
things change good happen 
things dont change things happen 
19billion dollars money problem appreciate 
government fund years decades maybe centuries create useful fund poverty hunger 
actually save peoples lives billion dollars 
strongly believe money illegible scientist care little people need 
admit great benifits like satillites planes useful acctually help need 
believe benefitial areas need billion dollars issue space exploration money goes things useful 
saying stop funding saying equal funding 
think money different ways spend money space exploration 
spend billion dollars space exploration 
budget 
think money different ways like living problems medicine food 
think money help people homeless 
money build houses 
46.2 million americans live poverty 
nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine points lives 
poor people money food lives 
unhealthy food lunch dinner 
affect health 
thinner thinner 
countries like africa kids money help 
food 
people difficulty paying housing 
help build cheaper houses 
money prevent spread diseases 
example malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
help hanging nets beds protect people bitten sleep 
nets cost dollars 
people affected malaria afford nets 
money medicine save lifes 
think important space exploration 
space exploration environment

money space exploration compare money spent national defense education renewable energy 
billion dollars spent national defense billion dollars spent space exploration 
billion dollars spent education makes billion dollars like small money 
finally space exploration helped avoid 
1960 instead having lots people killed severely injured space race instead 
conclusion author convinced giving lots reasons exploring space 
hope space exploration keeps going 
problems hunger poverty tackled space exploration 
space exploration benifet humans 
times people want reconsider space projects honestly come handy 
blowing bomb seconds focus space exploration help

need stop space exploration 
space travel important know going outside planet need focus planet situations problems 
economics important traveling space look pretty stars 
need money help communities milies injured debt family starving kids school 
families getting paid minimum wages want 
family right africa getting diseases malaria iould suffer severely 
money afford nets safe 
right spending billion dollars looking pretty stars space 
people favor billion dollars space exploration said 
billion dollars alot 
billion spend world help people neeed 
money satellites monitor condition crops soil rainfall drought 
positive like improving satellites dvces distribute food better 
space explorations motivate beneficial competitions nations 
space exploration solve human problems life 
fund space exploration spite problems earth 
cons pros funding space exploration expensive lead advancements medicine technology help resolve hunger poverty conflicts earth 
compared amounts money spend military education renewable energy money spend space exploration miniscule 
national budget scathing compared billion dollars 26.3 national budget spend military 
space exploration lead technological medical advancements 
according nasa scientists monitor astronauts health stressful conditions 
result medical instruments developed 
improvements exercise machines airplanes weather forecasting thanks space exploration 
problems earth need solve poverty space exploration actually help resolve problems draw attention away 
example satellites launched space monitor plots land 
relay valuable information growth crops 
lead improvements produce distribute food effectively helping people earth fight hunger 
space exploration push aside help people earth improve lives 
space exploration reap tangible benefits technological medical advancements reap emotional rewards 
look resolve inspiration achievements space travel like landed moon spark kind determination feeling proudness 
conclusion help improve life earth fund space exploration 
reading article believe space exploration going 
example satellites circle earth lots land important satellites send photos poor places need help 
example imagine human suffering nations competed planet exploring spaceships insted bomb dropping planes 
example russia wanted space moon good technology threats 
nice people explore space peacfuly hurt peoples lives 
final piece evidence investment space exploration especially worthwhile lead tangible benfits example area medicine 
nasa allowed astronouts missions scientists monitor heath stressful conditions

author convince space exploration necessary spends alot money think helps world 
reason think space exploration necessary takes money 
spend billion dollars year space exploration thats activity 
instead spending money billion dollars acitivity thats useless feed children familys 
46.2 million americans live poverty wasting billion dollars space exploration hobby scientics thinks important earth 
space exploration includes rockets includes rockets launching space 
fuel boots rockets space environment 
rockets lose resources 
harm animals grasses trees fuel 
reason space exploration uneeded things space exploration wastefull 
satellites rockets kind rovers need time patience build program 
instead wasting time help world instead 
feed poor saving money help need 
space exploration wastes money ruins environment runs resources wastes time building 
opinion think fund space exploration

conclusion people agree space exploration things space exploration prevented happened 
people dead starvation poverty stress good things like nowdays 
hope convinced space exploration good thing 
funding space program downs opinion think 
funding program help future tell weather help fuel piece example future making piece trying build space ship mars bigger bomb plane 
internet cell phone 
second example tell weather going rain hail storm tell people evacuate city protection 
piece evidence fuel people need fuel cars trains busses opinion think rocks moon rocks power trains cars items future 
piece evidence came safety like people need nets fund space program competition moon instead building bombs stuff 
funding space program cost money 
total national budget spend money education spend money defence sell money reunibbe energy 
funding space program actually help kill disaesis sickness scientist study people went space headaches sick 
hope persuayed essay funding space program takes dollars household good investment newer things 
think space travel gasoline harming earth oceans 
right government spending billion dollars year space exploration 
countries people dying access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
pollution cause global warming kill animals world 
government spending money space travel people need money needs 
money different countries people dying lack need order survive 
example people need clean water stay hydrated medical care help sick people solutions things 
think space travel people animals affected happens 
reading article convinced fund space exploration 
reason rising meet challenges space exploration nasa scientists developed innovation improved lives 
explains difficulties space exploration scientist space help problems

billion dollars total national budget 
lastly space exploration especially worthwhile tangible benefits 
space exploration helping things space helps mankind solution problems conflicts earth 
example satellites built space exploration program nasa measure conditions crops soil rainfall drought 
conclusion believe space exploration worthwhile benefits earth continue funded 
question agree space exploration 
think important continues program small cost food 
average spends billion dollars space programs mentioned little national budget 
course ridiculous spend billion dollars national defense 
reason police departments park services 
things focused 
heard news ambulances city 100k miles 
stop trying help 
person injured 
killing people different country making things secure home 
point trying maybe budget national security money city town security 
cops parks recs better ambulances 
probably country stronger showing care citzens 
space exploration 
write cops ambulances 
country getting reputation shootings crimes 
space helped 
helps showing better images know environment looks like satellite imaging 
space programs helped medical program equipment stress human body 
helped safer planes 
helped news prodcasters better images weather patterns storms 
better images high pressure systems 
space program helps soil crops suffering food brought 
nasa helping people 
making jobs helping scientists explore outer regions space 
point nasa helping helping regions study time 
think space exploration kept 
idea space exploration highly expensive 
americans live hunger poverty 
expenses exploration spent effect people live hunger 
believe explore space sake america 
quoted 46.2 million americans live poverty 
nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicines point life 
countries clean water medical care prevent diseases like malaria 
better struggle survive 
stop space explorations 
people live hunger poverty 
space explorations technology highly expensive making people struggles 
people think alot things earth space exploration 
people world suffering hunger sickness medical care 
think space exploration important need movement earth stop global warming late 
help need stop hunger sickness billion spent space exploration help people africa 
people sickness causing 
theres special prevents aford worth 
said article mostios bite people sleep people year people malaria 
invest money things benefit lives earth like having solar powered cars houses electronics 
people need offer 
food people need 
improve things destroy planet difference nasa creating ideas future better machines destroy plant 
think money space exploration need improve earths unhethy condition late 
author convinced space exploration disirable 
convinced cires inventions 
cure cancer posisible 
author convinced says takes away peoples money alot people dying 
spend alot money space exploration spend dollars mosquito repellent screen 
people africa need dollars screens malaria 
50/50 question 
space exploration help help 
people money city bills hardly money goes space exploration 
space exploration good 
help help 
people people live 
people bills home 
money goes space exploration 
space exploration help cures illnesses takes alot people 
people sure whats right wrong 
billion dollars space exploration alot people 
people cheap 
pathetic spend money help 
help cures illnesses 
help fine cures 
thats sure going help 
cure knows space exploration 
wont help 
space exploration theres 
waster money took people homes killed people 
sure choose 
people imposible space 
space exploration good inventions 
come save money 
future space exploration knows possible possible 
thats people expect unexpected 
confusing question 
50/50 good 
alot help help humans 
think money space exploration save money government sick homeless food feed peoples mouth 
kids schools school paying teachers government 
think education kids helpful going outer space 
earth polluted people smoking cars planes 
prices going running 
need electricity environmental saftey cars 
reasons think money space exploration billion dollars 
instead help people africa 
like said paper people getting diseases cure help money 
dollars dollars little 
maybe money away free food like christmas 
space exploration good thing helps improve mathematic science technology skills 
finding right build rockets satellites rovers takes skill education 
sending satellites help monitor earth crops soil rainfall weather 
satellites detect near objects like meteors aware close earth 
nasa scientists developed products helped lives including airplanes exercise machines 
space exploration helps discover earth surrounded 
space machines allow discover information planets stars galaxy 
possibly life planet likely galaxy galaxies 
invest billion dollars space exploration sound like total national government 
nearly spend military billion dollars 
better military fund country spends nearly 
money proverty ways stop polution 
believe space exploration desirable know planets life like earth 
reasons desirable 
author convince continue space exploration putting money going medical causes poverty 
imagine fossil fuels taking rocket shuttle moon/space 
know says helps locate crops things 
easier better burning fuels environment billion dollars helping people medical care food/water shortages ground 
helping people poverty important help money afford medical care cured diseases killed 
believe funds different source billion dollars clean renewable energy distribute benefitting earth space exploration 
probably thinking idea idiotic feud earth development space travel 
taking fund clean renewable energy cause included earth changing case forgotten making sure contributing better world 
taking away entire fund renewable energy risky distributing ways earth space keeping cause earth cause easier funding issue 
distributing cause earth trying improve not-so-clean-green planet 
help slightly poverty problems like africa 
malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
possible lower spread disease hanging large nets beds protect people bitten sleep 
nets cost 
believe space travel able improve life earth greatly consider continuously funding think lives earth come 
space travel important considering safety earth important opinion 
long space helping earth think funding space travel important funding planet safety 
conclusion think split different funds greater benefit space travel earth contribution 
think helping earth important space travel 
reading article convinced support space exploration 
reason nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food mediciane poin lives 
important 
people 
poor 
sell child money feed rest example opposition space exploration malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
choose quote people africa poor cost hard money disease 
goverment budy helps presidant waste money space exploration 
reason scientist believe pollution burning fossil fuels gasoline harming oceans 
important gasoline poisnous breath large chance dying 
people waste money space exploration 
reason maintain position presidant govenor waste money space earth 
disided investing money space things 
governments money 
plus useful useful 
maybe help maybe help earth knows 
worth shot 
living things know people want cancel space program 
nasa finds ways help earth 
finding things 
instead making bombs bomb eachother 
race country land mars 
planets 
like cold 1960s moon wins 
space unknown need explore 
maybe planet like earth live 
cool live know cancel space program 
plus help control satilites internet cell phones 
dicisions space program 
hope 
thank good

agree providing nasa space exploration nasa spends billion budget u.s. force billion dollars defence 
nasa better technology 
technology nasa provided lets know weather going 
nasa provided better planes exercise machines 
sattalites monitor alot land line readable paper weather conditions crops 
providing better technology nasa brought best 
space exploration helped creative society making want know scientific knowledge 
progress making chalenging goals witch created work 
allso inspire nations 
example cold russia united states raced better race space 
nasa astronaughts space monitor health stress 
ensure safe come 
reason medical instruments 
finaly agree nasa provides scientific knowledge 
sattalites monitor earth provide better ways knowing weather conditions crops provide better radiers bring best

article biased h4h4h4 
article supports space exploration majority support space exploration 
think problems earth hunger poverty 
national budget 
funds war/national defense deal problems 
okay thinking agree author 
course 
personally think waste money 
sure educational purposes 
want learn 
inside black hole/ worm hole/ outside milky 
dealing current problems like pollutions diseases overuse resources 
deal crap world suffering 
gives flying feather galaxies earth actually came 
bang kiss table 
sure earth billions help reduce/ prevent pollutions ozone layers going fried going earlier 
earth 
think funding space worth stop 
going space helped predict weather advance math science people countries like africa dying hunger disease 
reasons worth 
predicting weather know giant thunderstorm come kill prevent donating money foreign countries 
advancing math technology worse science thing math inspired machines giant meteor death came 
stop funding technology good 
need cameras zoom close atom atoms 
need flying cars buildings float 
need people dying 
help people foreign countries shut cheat people buying iphone crummy projector 
clear pause space exploration throw away people need money need mcdonalds 
think author wrong said spend money space 
think spend money poor people poor people baby need money people going space 
need money things important like poor people making houses poor people shalter things 
making schools giving money people africa people afford home 
according article believe continue funding space exploration 
reason money spent space exploration help people need medical care food water 
ways create cleaner energy insted fossil fuels 
lastly cause greater risk injury exploration 
reason believe stop funding space exploration billion help people need 
africa mosquito bites causing disease known malaria 
prevented hanging large nets peoples beds mosquitos away 
nets cost 
people need afford government stopped funding space exploration money malaria suffering people 
people want fund space exploration claim funding help discover technology evidence support technology work waste money 
reason stop funding space exploring money cleaner energy resources 
moment burning fossil fuels polluting environment 
money currently space exploration went finding cleaner energy resources healthier planet cleaner 
people funding space exploration claim space exploration countries prevent bombings objection countries betray peace 
objection increase risk explorers getting injured space 
think space exploration fundamental government spends billion dollars year strongly agree money help people food housing medicine cost 
understand traveling space discover things space like changing 
onlike space earth needs 
example fund space exploration people able housing bills cause people boying food 
space exploration motivate beneficial competition nations dangerous bomb dropping airplanes oxygen space easier earth 
fund space exploration 
agree going space good idea 
space earth 
space know things know 
like troposphere mesosphere therosphere 
know planets like 
nasa good inovations 
inovations help life 
like solar power exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting forcasting 
billion dollars national budget total buget 98.8 left nation 
billion dollars spent education 
spent clean renewable energy 
agree space makes 
fund fund help better technology better medicine help produce distribute land help invent technology 
article says include better exercise machines better airplanes better wheather forecasting 
article says resulted technologies nasa engineers developed space travel possible 
fund nasa 
causes earth benefits theres benefit 42.6 million americans live poverty article says nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine point lives 
bunch people africa mosquitos prevent nets cost 
choice rush spend money 
unites states government continue fund space exploration 
cost high benefits space research exploration outweigh 
past efforts space exploration resulted better technology medical knowledge thought life gives people hope 
u.s. government spends billion dollars year space exploration 
like money grand scheme things 
billion dollars total national budget 
u.s. govement spends national defense billion dollars annually 
instead taking space exploration budget u.s. government military spending order poverty 
space exploration ceased people work poverty increase 
space exploration resulted better medical knowledge better technology 
preparing space travel nasa needed ways monitor stress order astronauts healthy 
resulted better knowledge stress affects causes 
nasa created better exercise machine better weather forecasting better airplanes research space travel 
importantly space exploration gives people earth hope 
gives hope life planet 
thought life motivates people help 
space exploration people interested science 
space exploration encourages creativity brings people search common goal 
united states government continue space exploration benefits outweigh cost 
space exploration helps fields medicine technology 
space exploration unites nations common goal gives people hope 
funding continue space exploration 
author convinced space exploration desirable needs earth 
agree author wrote plethora reasons 
author states billion dollars money 
glance absolutely thought works money spent space exploration tiny percentage 
calm military forces money help 
secondly author says medical technology advanced doctors learned stress human bodies 
agree improving health problems space benefit earth 
plus better recording machine lead better technology weather forecasting

think fund space exploration maybe space disease spread able continue journey space 
think author convince inventions space exploration diffcult important challenge provides motivates bring best 
americans difficulty living like housing food medicine 
tennis shoes wear materials space boots 
maybe space exploration food hunger 
satellites circle earth monitor lots land know whats going land water 
check measures conditions weather 
good thing satellites going earth site problems going 
space exploration hurt hard heal

earth better place 
stop space exploration costing government earth 
lots americans suffering poverty today 
government spends billions payer money nasa 
space exploration help people near future 
people probaly spend money things like helping africa instead going space 
spend billions dollars space race 
invest money clean energy space smoke acid rain place 
earth messed people burning fossil fuels 
need modern clean ways power country 
reasons stop space exploration 
poverty pollution money wasting reasons stop space exploration 
recommend support stopping space exploration 
need billion dollars things important 
article persuaded money spent space exploration worth 
author pointed spend small percentage income space exploration 
little compared money spent education 
putting money uses different 
agree nasa improved lives people earth 
created things 
example nasa better airplanes 
travel hard machines dangerous 
nasa possible track large areas land satelites 
information improve earth 
space exploration exciting space race 
u.s.a. russia wanted land explore planets 
exciting citizens waiting results 
discover countries chance 
think author convinced space exploration funded 
agree funded lots benefits come space exploration medicine 
medicine tools people sick lead deaths nunger poverty 
satellites interesting 
monior land crops soil rainfall droughts 
satellites defenitely improve production food help hunger 
government help fund space exploration hunger/poverty government lower money national defense national defense little national budget 
believe government lower budget national defense raise need 
believe innovations gained space innovation important 
helps human lives comfortable sametimes easier help hunger poverty 
altogether think government shalld lower costs defense needed money help people struggling hunger poverty 
people explore space 
think people explore space 
learn space 
figured approximately longer dies hopefully planet living species 
people billion compared billion billion military educational 
billion education specificaly science 
astronauts like world gravitational rotation forever 
protect people track meteors falling 
people young probably electronics 
young people including probably enjoy internet texty cell-phones playing games 
adults work time 
adults outside work phones time 
possible scientist rocket science engineers built/build satelites 
lastely hunger solved satelites 
satelites check crops check rainfall 
brings topic weather satelites clouds 
people outside going rain 
think space exploration desierable 
helps improve useful machines improves medical conditions motivate benifical competition nations 
reason think desireable helps improve useful machines healthy 
example include better exceriseing machines better airplanes better weather forcast 
shows space exploration improves parts everyday lives 
second reason think desireable helps medical conditions 
live better life 
example medical instruments developed doctors learned human body reaction stress 
shows space exploration help reduce 
reason think space exploration desireable motivate benificial nations 
stop suffering bomb explosions nations competing 
example called cold united states russia competed prove greatness race explore space 
shows space exploration stops violent wars bombs 
instead replace violent wars non-violent wars like having race space 
save lives 
think space exploration desireable 
helps improve machines medical condition motivate benifical competition nations 
help live better life 
space exploration desirable theres earth 
sides space exploration good continue 
money space exploration spent improve peoples lives earth 
think money people need 
46.2 million americans live poverty reasons difficult paying house little money food afford medicine 
people little percent higher 
people dying diseases

spending money earth beneficial money space 
46.2 million americans live poverty space exploration help 
money wisely maybe help bring americans poverty 
approximately half americans today struggling money think space exploration wait 
space exploration takes billion dollars help people need 
countries africa people dying things easily fixed 
malaria disease spread mosquitos kills africans year 
easily fixed hand sleep mosquitos dont 
nets cost dollars people affected afford 
space exploration maybe africans money needed nets 
think humans ones harmed think 
earth suffering 
harmful fossil fuels damage oceans 
space exploration taken clean fresh program energy things like cars houses 
conclusion need help space exploration 
money space exploration help clean planet 
result poverty lower world pollution come people live longer happier lives 
rocket fired theft citizens suffer hunger poverty says presidents 
money wisely things needed 
space exploration desirable needs earth 
personally think worth 
like question stated needs earth 
space exploration cost 19.2 billion dollars 
19.2 billion dollars schools 
schools probably need books bathrooms 
19.2 billion dollars total national budget useful helpful things states cities need 
chances finding useful space 
chances probably 
useful space probably spaceships like 
poverty huge problem 
46.2 million people live poverty 
half trouble paying housing food medicine point lives 
19.2 billion dollars help people 
economy profit based 
maybe space exploration solution earth 
lead long term benefits 
waste money 
essay going spending money explore space help earth 
theres lots stuff study earth 
theres people poor need help planet little 
exploring space know plants solar help teach kids science 
point view agree need teach plants labor work 
learn planets space 
need learn earth need know planets space know 
learned earth rotate 
core need water live weather like 
childrens need learns education life school learn thing earth 
spend money going space explore planets work worth learn 
children schools learned late late earth 
like plants weather clouds water animals volcanoes maybe whats inside earth 
explore space makes learn planets solar 
makes learn planets work gives lots lots information work 
important learn 
grow daughter tell questions want know like earth works learning important 
scientist space explore planets know planets 
scientist ones explored space earth works 
great learn thing earth planets 
believe space exploration funded 
people spending space exploration funding help current situtations like helping earth people 
disagree 
space exploration money spends minimum compares current funding research renewable resources billion billion space exploration lead finding better fuel-source thats renewable 
maybe better engines supplys nasa send astronauts planet contains certain harmless fuels 
people worried current fossil fuels harming planet government funding money support space exploration earth currently 
whey searching familiar surroundings spectacular findings search renewable fuel source 
cold americans russians mentally competing moon americans wound winning 
healthy space competition boost research time help reach findings instead waisting billions dollars innocent lives bomb foreign nations 
people space exploration look planets findings research space exploration innprove daily things like weather forcast better airplanes safe efficient 
conclusion space exploration funded better things help earth 
author convince explore space problems earth 
money rocket ships explore space probebly money help places problems economy life example people africa india suffer disease called malaria come 
moscito bites

author convince space exploration desirable needs earth author mentioned human diseases pollution earth needs fixed 
author mentioned billion dollars spent renewable energy 
billion dollars renewable energy instead space exploration change 
need care 
space explorations wait later 
right earth danger 
renewable energy decade earth carbon dioxide results heat 
reason think space exploration desirable space experiments reactions stress 
mean help earth humans 
waste billion dollars 
change money renewable energy 
reasons disagreeing space exploration 
author convince explore space problems earth 
example people poor billion dolars help poor giving money waste space explorations people like africa nets prevent people getting malaria 
cost 
reason throw money planets galaxis 
people debating continue space exploration 
benefits believe focus problems earth like people poverty diseases worldwide problems 
spend billion dollars space exploration year 
money help homelessneess poverty diseases 
people homeless live poverty 
nearly 46.2 million americans living poverty 
half american culture trouble paying food housing water 
people africa malaria afford 
money help people 
second earth suffering 
polluting oceans burn fossil fuel 
money invest programs clean energy

think continue space exploration benefits 
satellites track land droughts food helpful 
takes money 
believe continue space exploration 
save money diseases poverty energy 
author changes mind space exploration desirable needs earth author right billion dollars spent defense 
billion dollars spent space exploration 
author wrote learn space solar astronauts space 
space exploration know weather moon 
convinced spend billion defense like countries 
concentrate poverty 
author writes people africa suffer malaria mosquito bites 
people homes access clean water clothing 
money spent stop poverty instead defense violence 
earth suffering global warming vehicles road automobiles burn fossil fuels 
fossil fuels earth greenhouse gases 
greenhouse gases trap heat atmosphere 
ozone hole ozone thinner 
ozone protects earth ultraviolet radiation turning oxygen atoms greenhouse gases turn chlorine atoms chlorine atoms turn ozone oxygen 
ozone hole earth turns warmer 
instead paying military spend money clean energy save earth like author wrote 
conclusively space exploration funded taxes defense 
think space research program good idea money help lots straving people 
need stop polluting energy based materials 
need stop polluting ocean need money clean spill lots animals dying cause pollution

author convince explore space problems earth 
think stop problems earth like maleria proverty polution 
19,000,000,000 3,800,000,000 nets people africa afford 
proverty dont waste 19,000,000,000 space exploration 
spend money rocket fails space waste alot money failed 
save money solve problems 
spend money things help planet 
agree people dying 
spen billion explore space 
author said causes pollution 
help ocean agree 
opinion healing earth important space exploration 
lots benefits space travels unnecessary benefits 
like example better exercise machines important block getting fresh instead running stuffy house running machine 
running machines dangerous hand body stuck machine running 
instead pouring money making space ships government donate money different charities orphanages poor people help live better 
people dieing africa malaria government money people need nets afford instead making rockets moon 
11th paragraph writer says united states russia competeing explore space helped countries bomb true 
countries competetive started bombing space ships moon planets 
happened 
think space travels unnecessary healing earth comes 
think space exploration good tangible benefits 
second challenge space exploration nasa scientist developed innovations improved lives 
finally problems hunger poverty tackled space exploration 
space exploration worth tangible benefits example area medicine 
nasa allowed astronauts missions scientists ways monitor health stressful condition safety astronauts harsh conditions experience launch return 
medical instruments deployed doctors learn human body reaction stress 
challenge space exploration nasa scientist developed innovations improved lives 
include better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
technologies engineers developed space travel possible 
problems hunger poverty tackled space exploration satellites circle earth monitor lots land 
track measure condition crops soil rain fall drought 
people earth info improve produce distribute food helping solve problems earth 
think space exploration good 
doctors learn human body space 
scientist develope things machines improves lives 
furthermore satellites help improve solve problems earth 
think fund space exploration people poverty spending billion dollars space exploration 
united states competition russia space exploration billion budget 
waste money like space exploration 
something/ suffering poverty 
billion dollars alot mere total budget 
little save lives 
people want fund space exploration want prove russia good technology 
space exploration important ending poverty be-cause lets universe 
thesis statement space ex-ploration postponed later date order save people 
reading persuasive paragraph think fund space exploration 
goverment trips moon mars atleast safe live mars moon future preference 
budget cuts happening abit lower things funded 
reason government space exploration roomers earth polution panning clear mars moon future future grandsons/granddaughters live produce children 
reason goverment fund space eploration kids learn science solar kids wont think science study science boring 
reason money space exploration 
space exploration scientists trying planets kids/scientist missing unknown planets solar newly updated anymore study solar 
solar 
conclusion percentage space exploration money 
ammount money funded billion dollers 
space exploration 
like billion 
think space exploration 
think funded money 
author convince space exploration desirable billion dollars earth 
example 46.2 million americans live proverty billion dollars help people instead spending need 
articel states countries people dying access clean water food medical care 
billion dollars people access needs need 
words didnt spend money space people wouldnt dying hunger everyday medical care 
africa afford nets wont bitten mosquitos getting disease called malaria 
people everyday disease 
instead billion dollars explore space society better

africa people malaria dieseas mosquito bites 
money nets mosquitos away 
think told information explore space things earth need help 
satellites circle earth monitor lots land 
track measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
despite problems earth believe continue support space exploration 
think 
fuel needed launch rocket polluting earth rocket brings huge benefits 
benefits help scientist researching helps daily citizens u.s. receive accurate weather forecasts inventors inspired develop improved technologies 
motivate people begin beneficial competition nations 
think launching rocket country suffer poverty thought effort astronaut puts space 
astronauts goals space discoveries soon huge impact lives world history 
exploring earth seriously save 
example year 2012 people said world nasa continuously collected data 
course citizens paniced going happen 
weeks stated date nasa successfully proved false statement 
correct 
world 
space exploration bring huge costs mean return benefits 
inspire young kids 
weather forecasts turn absolutely accurate 
space exploration called space exploration 
economy great 
spend billion dollars guarantee earth technologies invented advanced interesting facts discovered recorded condition crops importantly scientific knowledge specific 
consider future advanced scientific knowledge 
books school district schools fascinating lead better education 
students marina

benefits nasa space exploration 
nasa obtains national budget billion dollars obtain benefits 
information text importance space exploration author writes investment space exploration especially worthwhile tangible benefits forexample area medicine 
means space exploration discoveries stress medicine 
medical instruments engineered nasa probably hospitals helping patients 
alot benefits earth space 
nasa provided innovations hunger knowledge discovery 
strive knowledge motivates greater accomplish feats 
article author states 1960 united states competed russia build spacecraft moon 
indicates motivated united states america accomplish great things 
country great things space exploration 
think differently 
article states money space exploration widely benefit people living poverty 
billion dollars space exploration national budget alot people need 
money housing apartments food less-fortunate 
unlike space exploration benefits knowledge alot problems earth 
money nasa alot thought bigger purposes 
alot benefits space exploration including ones help major food poor money stay 
think poor need donate 
space exploration beneficial problems earth 
author convinced space exploration desirable needs earth 
think spend money space travel bounty reasons 
firstly space exploration helped tackle medical problems earth 
quote passage nasa allowed astronauts missions scientists ways monitor health stressful conditions 
help doctors stay home plant 
example sick verge passing away doctors monitor need 
possibly save peoples lives 
keeps nations going wasting valuable lives 
nations compete accomplish thins space create machine 
energy world better increase know space 
knows answers biggest problems earth steady energy source solved venturing unknown 
instead making missles kill lets missles explore space 
lastly money spent space exploration 
billion dollars sound like money total national budget 
dollars spent nation dollar cents spent exploration space 
united states spends 26.30 dollars national defense 
need defend 
countries allies 
space exploration spends little budget positive useful 
space create jobs 
think going space good nation 
ways waste money beneficial 
think invest space travel 
think section question consider said africans milaria means spend money medicine 
think continent fight country cause small think continent taking care animal country continent 
think space exploration happen needed living things suitable area humans different planet said question condier humans suffering earth suffering cause population 
nasa trying hard prove space exploration working wonderful think space exploration needed 
people lots pros cons going space going space 
convinced going space good 
convinced author article provided reasons exploring space 
people againist going space good reasons going space going space help discover things 
going space good discover things people 
people againist going space think money actually 
billion dollars sounds like national budget 
space exploration leads benefits like medicine 
satellites monitor land 
satellites tell trouble occuring 
people think going space 
think costs national budget 
earth suffering problems like fossil fuels poverty 
satellites record going earth 
recorded ways help suffering 
space exploration scientists invent things helpful 
conclusion think going space good 
people againist think space exploration helps lives earth 
article convince natations budget hobos space program 
spending money know good idea 
saving peoples lifes important taking pictures space 
knowing people suffer 
space funding believe need exploration 
need satellites watch earth meteor rushing earth 
satellites screwed seen coming need know whats planet 
things harm 
money feeding children funds kinda messed instead giving million feed children actually feed money 
believe need space explorations 
earth suffering said article space things like elements year government uses million dollars fund space programs believe money going good government uses money irrelevent 
stuff like 
nasa scientists developed innovations improved lives space funding continue 
author convince fund space exploration 
46.2 million americans streets living poverty 
instead money space exploration support americans earth 
people dying malaria 
dying money nets prevent malaria 
nets cost 
instead lots money space help people dying 
people space exploration help earth setting satellites monitor crops rain droughts 
needed 
world fine 
dont need fancy satellites monitor earth 
easier money support people dying live poverty 
beginning think space exploration desirable needs earth 
reading convinced 
course space exploration takes money 
money help people need like people suffer disease malaria 
money space exploration good purposes space exploration benefit good purpose 
author states billion dollars 
total national budget 
shows spent space exploration compared spent education 
measely 
started long time anyways space exploration brought benefits 
secondly 'medical instruments developed doctors learned human body reaction stress 
space exploration allowed medical instrurments developed help 
example help doctor learn human body reaction stress 
stated passage reasons space exploration help develop innovations improved lives 
better excercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting space exploration 
things helped 
finally space exploration allowed satellites track measure condition crops soil rainfall droughts 
finding help improve produce distribute food 
help solve problem earth 
think space exploration 
agree author 
space exploration helpful 
allows invent better things like better airplanes 
helps learn human body 
space exploration help solve problems earth 
space exploration think worth taking risk 
space exploration develop concepts help 
perspective think waste money space exploration wants space 
people want space 
healing people important compared making healthy times 
think people donate money needs 
lots people wants better airplanes money airplanes 
people want funding exercising machines 
exercising machines healthy 
funding doctors important people need heal 
think waste money space exploration billion 
having spend lots money making government poor 
like space best 
conclusion think best money doctors food useful things 
know earth right wasting money space exploration 
believe spend space exploration help earth problems 
people earth poverty large money space exploration 
people money block bugs 
rockets fail cause deaths waste money broken experiments 
money space exploration resources useful helping earth 
uses space exploration useful 
scientists created ways monitor health stressful conditions better technology space excuse 
tried improve stuff space excuse stuff 
motives improve stuff like making money famous 
reasons people believe space exploration good 
satellites weather crop condition roads 
important help people lives 
kind race peaceful wars work 
space exploration waste money cause people poverty hunger money space exploration help environment

space exploration peaceful alternative fighting wars 
usually wars cost money munitions fight 
believe fund space exploration help monitor earth agriculture help create inventions incorporated everyday life peaceful alternative fighting wars 
space travel like great thing things need earth better 
like text said 46.2 americans living poverty difficulties money food medicine government spend billion dollars trying travel space 
government start realizing need focus whats happening earth america instead leaving experience things totally different place 
people problems earth 
scientists believe burning gasoline harming oceans 
need cleaner sources eco-system better place live 
forms energy cleaner better earth 
energy power cars homes factories 
things traveling space upside 
text says astronauts aloud missions space scientists monitor health stressful conditions 
medical instruments developed doctors able learn human bodies reaction stress 
having space travel learned 
upside machines better 
includes exercise machines airplanes better weather forecasting 
ending problems hunger poverty space travel 
lots places monitored 
great happen space travel 
honestly sure think space travel 
problems earth solved funding space exploration 
believe money send aircrafts space solving problems earth 
believe exploring money people sick need help 
opponent point view probably exploring universe inspiration counter argument late inspiration everybody keeps dying 
action 
agree author said sense crystal clear 
like said sure going space expensive totally worth evidence 
said billion dollars billion total national budget

proves funding space programs slowly improving life earth 
space explorations benefit cooperation/competition nations 
instead killing right stupid competition violence 
answers problems space 
quire exploring space 
continue space exploration 
stop 
people belive stop space exploration money things earth 
think space travel tangible benifits 
think space travel great going 
provided motivation better technology helps medical advancements 
reasons continue space travel 
space exploration gives motivation 
makes want percent 
keeps curios know 
space exploration better technology knowledge

author convince space exploration important 
space exploration help discover medication gurantee discover medicine everytime launch rocket 
says article spend billion dollars year space exploration going space bring little piece knowledge 
believe space travel cool struggling economy important 
earth struggling 
send rockets equals pollution 
says article americans live poverty 
people children probably deal worldwide controversy bullying 
live poverty money latest trends relate posts online probably 
maybe money making poverty maybe middle class 
people jobs maybe suicides othe bully related problems 
saying bullying problems based poverty 
difference 
earth struggling global warming chopping trees pollution 
pollution giant factor animals endangered 
send rockets earth rockets polluting earth 
spend money planting trees protecting endangered animals 
spend time protecting migh improve 
improve planet healthy time ability space travel 
saving humanity live putting planets space 
think people stop funding space programs 
true problems earth exploration space help solve problem 
space exploration helped create medical tools taught doctors human bodys reaction stress 
nasa satellite monitor earth ways 
people funding space exploration helps solve great mysteries earth 
space exploration costs billion dollars year 
space exploration helped people education like math science 
people shut space exploration help earth

galleao species fasinated space 
beautiful rotation planets glorious fireball 
complex questions answered space 
earth come 
life planet 
think large universe small picture learn 
mars moon small stepping stones road discovery 
believe fund space programs 
course plenty problems earth 
according article americans poverty 
thousands people africa year cureable diseases afford solutions like mosquito decrease aful diesease malaria 
people argue billion dollar fund space programs americans suffering 
bullion makes budget 
goverment money billion dollars spend military

people dieing work answers space strive work countries share world 
russia china parts europe countries world wont spend money space exploration brains working 
people dissagrea think spending money space exploration mess planet 
agree 
believe planet 
faster planets like earth planets extra recorce analize recreateit 
feed people planet 
thank soviet union exploring space making interested space 
space exploration desirable needs earth 
think space exploration limited 
need help poverty earth pollution money wise 
need help poverty going earth 
46.2 million americans live poverty 
countries people dying access clean water medical care simple solutions 
limiting space exploration statistics showing 
trying help people earth going sleep starving everyday 
sure satellites pinpoint lots land help improve produse distribute food 
people help shouldnt seeing improvements poverty percentages 
secondly limit space exploration safety earth 
scientist believe pollution burning fossil fuel harming oceans 
long time troubles earth pollution 
people making worse sending rockets space time destroying planet 
helped innovation improved life 
stuff dont need like exercise matchiens 
lastly space exploration cost alot money 
government spends billion dollars year space exploration 
money children education poverty issues pollution issues 
categories recieve lots money categories need alot 
exploration space limited help poverty enviorment categories

title story importance space exploration 
today write considering reasons given article fund space exploration 
need support earth space exploration 
1953 president eisenhower says money hunger proverty 
space exploration money 46.2 million americans having difficulty paying housing food medicine lives 
example malaria disease spread mosquito bites 
prevented space exploration money 
people need helps earth needs help pollution oceans 
money invested creating clean energy 
money invested space exploration billion dollars 
people argued alot total national budget 
according national defense billion dollars money clean energy instead 
convinced need spend money space exploration 
plenty people need enormous ammounts money spent space exploration year 
average person earn billion lifetime 
americans live poverty ready 
billion dollars reduce 
want fellow americans suffer countries simply afford simple solution 
maleria disease africa lessened 
compare 19,000,000,000 
disease easily prevented afford wonder help form money spent researching space 
earth slowly dieing 
need spend money prevent 
mainly humans fault happening work harder 
concerned earth space exploration 
agree author stopping space programs planet things 
stop people dieing hunger 
people earth straving food water 
half americans trouble paying stuff live food water shelter medical bills 
live proverty 
people africa suffering

convinced shut space exploration 
know people saying rocket fired theft citizens suffered hunger poverty 
nasa allowed astronauts missions scientist ways moniter health harsh conditions 
medical instruments developed doctors learned human body reaction stress 
wanting raise challenges space exploration nasa scientists developed inventions improved lives 
including better exercising machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
results technologies nasa engineers developed space travel possible 
nasa scientists better developed airplanes space inventions know weathor right 
satellites circles earth moniter lots land example conditions crops soils rainfalls dought

medicine expensive people afford billion dollars people need 
woold able satillite better weather forecast ahead goinig happen like rain sunshine drought tornado 
better machine monitor health products lives better 
money help poor illed people people poor better world 
thats chose wait 
think fund space exploration money different causes 
poverty causes funded instead space exploration 
passage says 46.2 million americans live poverty 
passage says nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine point lives 
cause cause investing program develope clean energy 
countries like africa afford medication 
stop funding space exploration programs billions dollars causes 
believe space exploration important problems desperately need solved earth-including deadly diseases high crime rates poverty 
money spent space exploration greater cause planet opinion 
know americans living poverty 
instead billion dollars space exploration help support adults children access america suffering poverty 
lack food water shelter 
reason article convince pollution rates incredibly high country launch space explorer rocket pollutes 
think important burning fossil fuels creating unhealthy environment earth 
contribute decline entire planet general 
reasons article convince space exploration important 
greater issues earth money 
author convinced space explore happing world 
problems earth world 
national budget alot money thing like healing ones need heal education important thing life time 
space check astrow earth 
reasson important astrow kill billion billions people want people 
think author didnt convince space exploration desirable needs earth 
think traveling space costs money important things 
author didnt convince article kind bias especially paragraphs 
author lists benefits space travel issues 
hs/she puts little paragraphs he/she talking benefits space travel 
paragraphs author says money spent space travel things like people lives 
author mentions people dying malaria disease easily prevented 
spending money space travel dont left people need 
author didnt convince he/she talking space travel benefits he/she lists important 
like dont think people need better exersize machines 
he/she talking issues address issue caught attention think space travel cool people need money 
conclusion author convince space exploration desirable earth 
opinion think funding space program money explore space good idea 
funding space exploration help astronomers fund livable planets 
planet human beings live 
population grow live planets 
world hungry poverty solve essay said satellites monitor lands earth track measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
improve produce distribute food 
investment space exploration great achievements medicine 
scientists monitor health astronauts 
developed medical instruments doctors learned ways human body reacts stress 
reason invest space exploration scientists want face challenges space 
work harder meet goals eventually came innovations improved lives 
products include better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
resulted technologies nasa engineers developed space travel possible 
conclusion funding space exploration necessary order improve lives earth experience people experience 
desirable explore space someday amazing planets stars great accomplishment mankind 
agree exploring space important saving earth people suffering starvation 
agree like said population poverty explor space like having earth important situation polution 
think america national budget effectively 
arguments space exploration people believe united states spending money help world instead space exploration 
opinion actually space exploration programs believe programs expand knowledge universe 
think caring people world struggling space exploration important expanding horizons 
currently government spends billion dollars annually space exploration total national budget think compared 26.3 national budget spent national defense 
spent education 
reasons investment space exploration worthwhile lead benefits 
example developed medical instruments help monitor person condition stressful harsh conditions like ones astronauts undergo launch return helped doctors learn human body reaction stress 
example space exploration worthwhile innovations developed nasa scientists improving lives 
better weather forecasting better exercise machines better airplanes result technologies nasa developed space travel 
space exploration help ones hunger poverty 
satellites circling earth monitor large amounts land 
track measure condition crops rainfall droughts soil advantage improve produce distribute food

knowledge space inspires people creativity shine 
makes strive better technologies scientific knowledge 
space exploration inspire innovative work motivate beneficial competition 
like 1960 cold united states russia competed land spacecraft moon significant investment progress american education 
conclusion looking outward space improved life earth 
sparked creativity innovation helped expand knowledge great universe 
space exploration lead benefits society definately worth billion dollars 
space exploration scientists exploring space year 
purpose country sending space 
fund space exploration 
opinion think continue fund space exploration 
spend money astronauts space ships 
need observe check things going space 
costs money total 
americans live poverty 
difficulty paying foods clothes medicine point lifes 
money help people instead going space 
poor people americans 
countries africa people dying clean water simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
avoid mosquitos bitting 
addition people suffering earth suffering 
suffering polution 
fossil fuels coming rockets harm earth 
rockets space earth nice clean 
people worry everyday money afford housings 
people lived environment clean water healthy bodies 
countries plan explore space going planets like moon mars 
having desire landing planet 
want famous 
hand people favor space exploration argue billion dollars 
total national budget 
agree exploration money protecting people suffering poverty 
people state space exploration important motivate competition nations 
imagine human suffering avoided nations competed planet-exploring spacehips instead bomb-dropping airplanes 
scientists stop traveling space people earth organic farm plan plantations 
earth longer poluted 
definitely people suffering environment 
reasons space exploration 
think spend funds space exploration things know space able help earth 
article asks explore space needs earth 
going answer 
think instead spending money army planes spend money things earth help wound people apart 
read paragraph article people favor space exploration argue billion dollars 
total national budget 
compare billion dollars spends national defense 26.3 national budget 
army need defenses offenses best thing stop peace probably happen 
space exploration important places galaxy provide knowledge help tromendously open awhole feild research 
army shows small children hurt humans believe different things 
believe space exploration happened better thing worry earth 
need worry spaces 
countries people dying dont clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
earth suffering 
scientists believe pollution burning fossil fuels gasoline harming oceans 
need cleaner forms energy pawor cars homes factories 
46.2 million americans live poverty 
nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine point 
reading belief sould space 
thought space final frontier cool 
authors counterargument worked 
sure gave arguments space maters facts begining stick 
46.2 million people poverty 
read longer believe space 
lets start pvoerty 
mentioned couple sentences 46.2 million people poverry 
spending billion sending people uninhabited worlds bring rocks 
scientists fuss ones things affect 46.2 million people 
mars water great people learning healthy housed clothed 
water maters exists people dont water 
earth 
live planet inhabitle 
destroy dead space useless 
author says fossil fuels harming 
guess fuels rockets partly fossil fuel 
mention gasses released 
intill rockets renewable sources technology 
wreck space useless 
lets money billion space 
billion 19,000,000,000 spent sending tubes metal void rocks 
sure rocks cancer cures food everybody 
money funding education food instead spend rocks 
know feedin teaching children important magical space rocks 
kill earth starve refuse teach couple rockets wont difference 
need focus matters planet barren ones 
lets solve problems leave planet 
think space exploration space going know space 
reason space going know cuthing outside planet 
lost reason space exploration going know mars planet 
space cool interesting 
space exploration better technology 
space exploration space better live earth better 
space exploration inspire 
conclusion think space exploration better 
article convinces space exploration important history 
originally reading beginning article agreed things said 
spend billions dollars space exploration helping world 
billions dollar feed need 
spend adventures jupiter 
continued reading article good points 
paragraph seven mentioned improved area medicine 
advance basically allows human beings monatoned feel stressed gives doctors knowledge human reaction stress 
students today suffer stress 
million point test busy life human experienced stress 
knowing stress definitely lead better society 
good point space exploration training place created machines allow humans exercise 
child obesity rates getting higher higher definitely good exercise machines 
satellites able help farmers produce crops 
crops excess crops cheaper crops affordable 
crops affordable encourages people start buying fruits vegetables market double cheeseburger mcdonalds 
explanation shouldnt founding space program need money things world 
like real thought need giving money gone moon 
time 
think billion dollars think 
suggestion ened stop founding theim start changing thing public 
streets torned people dont cought thing 
need money education thought need schools 
need books supplies realy anymore computers money things actually need city 
space research needed better world earth solve problems space 
believe 
money wasted space research worth 
curious knowing world 
sooner later explore different world knowledge everyday materials better advanced 
total billion dollars space research looks like total national budget believe 
thanks billion dollars scientists researches able create medicine diseases better machines exercise better airplanes 
reasons space research necessary waste money people recall 
space research lead better world everybody 
researches form space help solved problems earth hunger 
spae sattellites monitor farming land predict better weather forecasting farmers 
sattellites distribute track condition soil crops rainfall needed 
help hunger problems tackle health problems 
researches able create helpful medicine machines body 
spend billion dolalrs space research help solve tons problems earth 
space research help motivate young minds difference world 
writer information usally talks food benitis example area medice 
scientis ways monitor health stressfull conditions 
think talk earth thats talking things earth 
theme outer space 
money outer space waste money 
need money need 
money poor money 
need save need money need 
people money people money 
poor need money house 
think continue fund space exploration 
onot think effictive united states spend money 
example article fund space exploration 
reason 46.2 americans live poverty 
second reason regards people contries diesises easy prevent 
final reason pollution earth need care 
reason beliving space exploration good spend money issue poverty 
46.2 millions americans currently living poverty 
fund space exploration money help need 
opinion helping lower poverty better money instead exploring space 
continue fund space exploration number people poverty higher higher instead lower want 
second reason cutting fund space exploration helping people contries 
example helping stop spread malaria africa 
malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
malaria easy prevent putting large mosquito nets beds people sleep bitten night 
nets costs people malaria afford 
money currently space exploration 
money currently space exploration people africa mosquito nets slow spread malaria 
final reason beliving fund space exploration anymore pollution 
polution burning fossil fuels harming oceans 
money cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
think stop funding space exploration money effective things earth 
think fund space exploration 
46.2 million americans living poverty hungry 
billion dollars help ghettos 
fossil fuels rockets harms earth atmosphere land ocean 
destroying earth death seeing effects pollution earth 
space exploration great come solution feeding poor 
answer simple 
money food 
know economy right 
spend national budget national defense useless things like space program helping people schools 
think exploring space 
cost money 
maybe spend money national defence says text money space exploring 
understand people want spend think spend earth concerns 
money space funds 
think people know space exploration help inventions medical instruments growing food says text 
peoples problems away space exploration 
people probably think earth problems come space exploration comes later 
knew earth problems away threw exploration space 
probably change mind money spent space exploration usefull space exploration earth 
says text 46.2 million americans live poverty money space exploration help 
understand able explore space decrease poverty time 
read text thought space exploration good spend money space exploration things 
author gave reasons maybe convince people space exploration good 
beleive spent going space becaus alot problems world 
solve earth problems explore earth 
'government spends billion dollars year space explortorium 
hand spent helping people education 
'indeed 46.2 million americans live poverty 
nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine need 
people disagrees thinks alot money spent space exploration 
budget hand billion dollars spent miliatry national defense 
billion dollars spent education 
billion spent renewable clean energy 
aurgument weak schools money students better education government budget spent alot national defense america defended 
help people explore outer space exploring outer space isnt important 
help word going explore outer space instead caring education people dying exploring space 
exploring space seeing outer space looks like exploring planets kind helpful important education poverty 
think space explortoron spent education helping spent 
disagree witht author claim space exploration desirable needs earth 
instead spending money space spend helping people need alot help cures sicknesses 
space exploration important worry happening earth 
article author states nasa given better exercise machines better aiplanes better weather forecasting 
thing helping biggest problem happening earth global warming 
better exercise machines going help stop global warming 
spending billion dollars space spending billion dollars renewable clean energy 
author states populaton burning fossils harming oceans billion renewable energy billion dollars billion 25.3 billion dollars renewable clean energy 
saving earth 
opinion need space exploration right going earth 
need face fact need start renewable energy everyday instead pollution burning fossil fuels 
completely disagree author clain article 
people wonder space exploration worth spending time 
think space exploration uneccesary 
world problems deal 
money space exploration important subjects helping poverty finding newer cleaner energy sources saving money 
world suffers troubles 
billion dollars year help troubles 
46.2 million americans suffer poverty 
example year people africa malaria 
prevent troubles budget space exploration 
secondly pollution fossil fuels 
money space exploration invest time finding newer cleaner source energy 
energy possibly stop global warming 
think space exploration help solve problems inspiring technologies advancements 
agree space exploration help world problems spend billion dollars space exploration invest money advancements ideas money 
instead space exploration help earth problems money directly help problems instead 
conclude feel space exploration uneccesary idea money help troubles effective efficient 
author convinced spend money space ccrnuccpia reasons 
earth 
president eisenhower said rocket fired theft citizens suffer hunger poverty 
people dying rocket money 
second 46.2 million americans live poverty 
poor people 
money 
half americans point bills doctors houses water bills 
people 
thirdly malaria disease caused bites mosquito africa people dying year disease 
stop mosquitos endanger lives 
mosquitos bite sleeping 
pretty expensive spending money lives instead space 
forthly atmosphere invest save money atmosphere 
spend money space spend saving earth earth better place environment 
conclusion think author convinced invest money saving earth 
exam malaria nets environmental cars proverty alive 
agree sides argument money spent help world 
think space funding money instead getting money 
united states government willing help people different places world

article question consider says americans live poverty 
sice nasa funding high decrease money money help americans 
life bunch people family struggle living support family 
africa disease called malaria life threatning 
people nets protect 
sure afford 
saying government money nasa funding money help people life 
paragraph talking away fundings agree think consider cutting fundings 
fundings astronaunts discoveries world 
people dream going space want help fund dreams 
right know career want astronaut definetly dream jobs 
think government fund nasa 
think agree sides articles feel important learn things life help people earth better 
decreasing fundings help charity better medicine people help charity giving money motivate people help 
sports lots players help charity think 
gave reasons decreasing fund people cutting funds 
know agree sides article 
hope government changes mind starts funding nasa 
hopefully able help discovery space world 
importance space exploration author convince space exploration desirable needs earth 
think government money defense education renewable clean energy 
people money government 
people money prepare disease 
people disease 
example like africa 
malaria little bite 
people kept bited malaria people dying 
money money 
money people 
government space exploration money donate africa people disease 
people money student great education 
future work government government money 
example cars 
alot people health 
like breathe body getting sick hard breathing finally people disease 
people lungs health 
opinion government money cars energy cars 
finally author convince space exploration desirable earth 
government budget things good people health 
example money african buying bite malaria cars 
think shouldnt space exploration people world suffering hunger poverty dont education 
said article rocket fired theft citizens suffering hunger poverty 
thats saying money spent space exploration feed people help things need afford 
second article says 'satellights circle earth monitor land grow crops hungry people 
helps hunger great sure people wont starve poverty medical supplys simple solutions/ cures diseases 
doesnt solve problems 
earth suffering pollution thing makes pollution fossilfuels 
rockets 
article states 'pollution burning fossil fuels gasoline harming oceans 
space exploration shouldnt going ways solved problems living 
agree author continue explore space problems earth 
people going space exploration want continue space exploration 
think stop space exploration money 
money help people 
save world population stopping people dying common diseases cure 
improve people lives giving need urgently 
save earth 
newer types energy producing machines 
people exploring planets home waste time money 
medicines cure diseases money 
save people africa dying malaria buying nets 
medicines common uncommon diseases 
donate medicines poor people poor countries 
cure alot people diseases 
people special herb planets medicine percent chance 
people land explore 
disagree statement forest build rebuild buildings newer buildings 
warehouses company store earn money 
think stop space exploration money help people lives 
money herbs medicines 
think improve situation taking useless buildings companyes 
money medicines helping people 
help alot people start space exploration 
strongly convinced space travel positively impacting government inventions 
aspects space travel harm earth greater benefits problems come research 
like favor space exploration think billion dollars money compared spent defense education clean energy 
money providing knowledge worlds gaining skills create elaborate tools 
medical inventions deeper knowledge body reaction stress originated monitoring astronauts health stressful conditions preparation launch return 
technologies nasa engineers developed space travel possible better exercise machines airplanes weather forcasting invented 
sattelites circle earth monitor lots land solve problems hunger poverty 
determine condition crops soil rainfall drought 
improve produce distribute food world 
technologies created space exploration community gaining motivation explore fields scientific knowledge 
example america russia competed space craft land moon 
true human problems earth space exploration helped solutions create innovations world 
space travel long-term benefits society greater immidiate cost helping hunger poverty earth 
believe focus space travel instead focus problems society right 
thoughts space travel waste money need focus sorting financial problems right place 
think continue space travel solving pollution problems 
says building rocket cost billion dollars meds health programs places need people dont disease 
space travel idea dont feel important 
fund schools children education deserve 
need focus think pointless fight 
feel waste money things important need focus society need improve lives people need improve education future generations 
space travel article called importance space exploration talks space travel important 
author convinced article space travel important 
think space travel waste money 
article author gave good reasons space travel 
space travel benefits area medicine better technology 
reason support investment space exploration better medicines 
article said astronauts harsh conditions like experiencing launch return 
stress doctors able know humans react stress developed medical instruments 
benefit improvement technology 
nasa scientist helped developed better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
satellites space helped 
example track measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
helped improve producing food 
reasons believed worth money support space travel 
author able conviced space travel benefits 
causes hunger poverty improves technology gives better living 
investment space exploration helps learn think space exploration desirable 
think fund space exploration needs earth 
money improve peoples lives 
46.2 million americans live poverty 
nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine point lives 
malaria diseases spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
disagree withe statem 
space exploration nessesary 
sure learn things space invent inventions 
scientists figure things imagine claim space exploration worth dealing earth 
people billion dollars compared money spend national defense education renewable energy 
space exploration motivate beneficial competition nations percentage human suffering lower plus bombs dropped completely destroying building stores people 
reasons space exploration suffering earth 
poor countries dying second diseases 
example mileria desease spread mosquito bites 
money space exploration nets beds 
lower deaths africa 
costs hardly africans purchase nets 
space exploration continues earth suffer 
global warming slowly destroys barrior earth keeps rays getting 
gases heat launch global warming concerning sunburn skin cancer 
earth people living things need exploration 
people protest saying okay means people hurt 
money space 
people earth 
alot people dying disease 
disease come bugs 
example type brings disease africa 
people africa dying biting residents night 
people trying protective skin 
finally people disease afford 
nearly half americans afford food houses water medicine 
countries people dying access clean water shelter medicine food 
money instead 
dollars access water person forever 
spend money space whats point alot people dying disease shelter access clean water food access medicine 
money space 
makes sence point 
think 
picture head 
people shelters access clean water medicine disease coming 
picture 
look horrible 
people earth instead 
watch movies world ends think happen earth 
makes scared makes wonder stop save earth mankind 
exact reason think stop funding space exploration 
people agree want stop space exploration earth better place 
problems arent earth better place 
problems arent ways money goes space exploration different reasons proverty americans spread diseases 
countries people need medicine diseases malaria spread mosquito bites 
people help money going space exploration 
work earth stop funding space exploration stay green 
save earth
