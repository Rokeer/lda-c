maybe waste money finding 
ways waste billion dollars 
stopped world hunger 
helped foster children 
money going space exploration dissapointing 
want 
money 
people think going stressed 
benefits 
sure 
think need pass tests going space 
like body stressed 
physical test 
like spaceship breaks crash flying uncontrollably 
know stuff like 
reasons money space exploration 
reason money obviously 
reason people going stressed 
problems earth 
yeah hoped enjoyed reasons 
people arguing funding space space exploration 
think fund space exploration problems need solve earth 
think stop funding space exploration able focus problems having earth 
money needed fund space exploration 
costs billion dollars year space exploration 
people think theft people suffer poverty hunger 
46.2 million americans live poverty 
africa people dying malaria cannnot afford nets protect 
second people need help earth 
earth suffering pollution fossil fuels harming oceans

like author said people money fund space exploration 
argued national budget 
think good points prove space exploration helping people earth 
like exploring space track conditions crops soil food world destributed evenly 
space exploration required 
things happening earth 
people dieing diseases malaria 
malaria form mosquito bites 
people nets protect poor 
people suffering paying food housing medicine 
people suffering 
earth pollution 
think spend money space exploration 
think lower budget space exploration billion billion 
money improve schools help earth 
president eisenhower said rocket fired theft citizens suffered hunger poverty 
true americans live poverty suffer everyday 
half americans face money problems eventually lower space exploration greatly reduce 
space exploration causes problems 
pollution rockets harm ocean 
problem bigger everytime launch rocket 
instead money cause pollution fund programs develop clean energy cause pollution 
fixed earth pollution maybe fund space exploration rockets 
think auther space danger true problems deal earth space explorations solving human problems 
space explorations important motivate beneficial competition nations imagine human suffering avoided nations competed plant-exploring spaceship instead bomb-dropping airplant 
providing inventions space exploration important challenge provides motivation bring best 
space exploration help remain creative society 
strive better technologies scientific knowledge 
think problems earth like said pollusion burning fossil fuels 
instead bombing wars ending world killing peace 
looked solar thousands times 
need hundreds times instead scientists looking things space look factory cars somergized different greener 
think spend money space exploration countries people acess clean water medical care solutions prevent diseases 
africa people dying disease called malaria 
malaria disease caused mosquito bites 
prevent malaria need cost 
people disease afford nets 
maybe people suffering earth suffering 
scientists saying burning fuel polluting earth 
need running cars homes factories 
need program develop clean energy 
goverment spend billion dollars year space exploration 
people think goverment spend money things helping people earth 
think stop alot money spaceship stuff 
people poverty starve survive 
earth suffering gasoline polute ocean 
earth 
1000 years earth poluted 
reason think continue cause television weather checking food earthquakes cell phones 
stay healthy 
inspire airplanes electronics 
think african people families live know malaria 
people starve live hunger diseases 
nasa uses money space exploration 
hunger place donates food people needy poor need live like 
live food 
holding funds space exploration hold funding space eploration problems earth 
money stop proverty 
money stop proverty increase funds medical care schools 
money stop global warming 
things improve earth continue funding space exploration 
reason money stop poverty 16.2 million americans living proverty 
africa people poor afford nets protect mosquito malaria 
need money help global warming destroying animals home food source 
stop proverty 46.2 million living proverty space exploration taking living proverty space exploration taking funds 
money ways help environment people think pollution caused burning fossil fuel problems fixed improving little stop funding space exploration 
fund fund space exploration 
think fund space exploration learn planet space 
poor people saying goverment space exploration money 
year goverment spends billion space exploration 
space exploration know whats space 
earth polluted 
cars drives everyday pollutes 
factories pollutes 
people saying stop funding space exploration cars drive factories work harming 
everytime breathe pollutes harm body 
think space exploration important health 
think space exploration stop away stop polluting factories 
billion space exploration away stop polluting 
exploring important health 
think exploration stop cure pollution 
billion help homeless 
away cars factories pollute 
polluted stop funding exploration 
learning space learn anytime pollute health 
think fund space exploration 
believe fund space exploration budget affected education 
nasa asks president loan fund nasa space look galaxy look 
away billion dollars budget time want space visit planet look star 
honestly useless thing spend money theirs bunch diseases going 
plus sicknesses cause death cancer fighters need medication treatments 
need clean atmosphere billion dollars going renewable energy benefital years oxygen carbon dioxide exist 
need money future financial 
especially people unemployed need fare money support family 
americans poverty like alot 
like 10.5 people homeless shelters need housing homeless programs help lives 
focus people dying hospitals today everyday 
agree space race besnees good making good cars house biltding good 
people help problems planed 
track measure condition crops earth spent futur 
help space program better explore space race prove good time space race 
solve problems earth 
problem hunger poverty tackle space exploration effort deal problem earth 
agaist space race significant invelment probeme 
people thought subject weather fund space exploration money things 
think funding space exploration benefits given 
space exploration going space need technology knowledge survive 
space exploration influences improvement medicine space sattilite technology helpful space competition nations 
cheap compared stuff spend budget 
astronauts stressful conditions entering space need type medicine 
doctors pefect medical instruments learn people feelings stress 
space exploration influenced calm stress 
fund space exploration probally know subject medicene 
people think money stopping hunger poverty 
problems solved satellites funded space exploration

people knowledge improve produces distributes food 
space exploration help nations want compete exploring space instead having nuclear wars 
example cold united states russia competed moon planets 
helped discover information planets progress math science 
space exploration help 
influenced medicine helped life problems like hunger supported idea space races instead 
tell friends space exploration required thing worth cost 
agree space exploration money help peoples bigger diseases come money fright diseases midsen kill diseases 
maybe space infenty wather food 
money help diseases time space ships 
maybe place like earth live better place things 
agreed author good point 
agree ideas example 'investing space prevent happening cause little compition people discovers

author change mind 
think space exploration desirable 
space exploration strive better technologys 46.2 million americans live poverty half americans difficulty paying houseing food medicine countrys people dying aaccess clean water 
earth need help burnig fossil fuels harm money work clean reusable fuels 
program makes reusable fuel inportant worth investment 
people diying disease example people africa diying becase afford large nets protect mosquitos carry diseases 
think space exploration desirable 
think space exploration desirable needs earth 
mean okay send satellite season monitor crops rainfall drought soil 
billion dollars probaly help people live poverty 
president einshower says rocket fired theft citezen money 
example author says american people live poverty 
alot people billion extra dollars help build shelters provide food poor 
scientists extra money invest program help pollution problem oceans

want save money hold protests petition signed 
sorry author persuade space exploration desirable needs earth 
article able convince space exploration good thing 
started reading believed beneficial money space exploration food poor mosquito nets people africa 
reading space exploration sounds like better choice 
immediately better spend money medicine instead not-so-distant future space exploration develop better solution maybe lasts like getting mosquitos africa buying nets 
true national budget 
money easily taken food national deffense 
billion dollars hardly dent nasa differense country moon letting russia 
proven space exploration beneficial ways

burning fossil fuels gasolin harming ocean 
need cleaner water need energy safer like power cars tecnoligy homes factories putting polution 
effecting animals 
animals water breath fuels 
asma 
messing money cause budget cuts people getting fired people money hard work 
money making jobs helping homeless people medical food 
good spend billion dollars stuff different things 
finally need prevent diseases thats spreading money spent 
people dying diseases like africa mosquito bits solve having sleeping 5.00 people afford causing issue 
thats think people space issues earth 
going space earth comes need need earth earth space 
dont opinon becase doest matter waist time said want true 
stop space exploratin people starving poverty education

'pollution burning fossil fuels harming oceans 
government spend money clean environment 
people believe money support poor think space exploration wasting money 
rocket fired theft citizens suffered hunger poverty 
space exploration human maybe human alive think save lives helping poor 
result think space exploration need spend money 
gather money save poor space exploration- human suffering avoided nations competed planet-exploration spaceships instead bomb-dropping airplanes 
money people disagree space exploration

space exploration gives humans alot benefits example better airplanes cleaner weather forcast better exercise macheins 
better airplanes help things example safer travel better flying conditions better technology harse weather traveling better effecient airplanes 
space exploration help better clearer weather forcast 
information wether monitor rainfall track measure crop conditions drought 
finaly ways improve exercise macheins example help people weaght probloms efeicient exercise macheins better easier 
advanced alot space travel example better airplanes better clearer wether forcast exercise think contuinue space exploration benifits human race 
convinced space exploring desireable earth 
space satillites revolting earth detect crops current status tell people improve conditions produce better crops distribute people undernouished 
million compared million spent defense 
able education people learn better courses defending self learn weapon 
space exploring important 
astronauts learn planets space 
astronauts know planets maintain life water 
fund space exploration help predict weather build better machines technology improve 
uses money compared national defense education 
space exploration improved life earth 
space exploration learn space improve life earth 
convinced invest money space exploration 
firstly provides distraction destruction 
stated article example 1960 
'cold competed russia prove greatness 
space exploration significant improvement technology 
include better exercise machines advanced airplanes specific weather forecasts 
important point exploring outer space progress education 
better education believe human race intelligent 
knowledge able solve problems starvation spread disease 
proving 'space exploration desirable needs earth 
believe americans fund space exploration benefits provides outweight consequences future 
stated article space exploration solving human problems instead help solve 
believe true progress solving human problems space exploration 
believe space exploration solution human problems nations creative competitive nations 
stated article space race russia u.s.a. resulted technological advances earth 
lastly believe people budget space exploration 
national budget space exploration compared 26.3 budget national defense 
believe money solve human problems gotten cutting budget stuff space exploration 
author convince fund space exploration waste money deal pollution happening earth waste money exploring space unknown planets 
reason fund space exploration people dying unknown diseases cure 
second reason people different countries access clean water electricity food housing 
reason money charity help people japan rebuild house things 
dont think author convince space exploration derisable 
didnt convince need finidg things earth 
like says paragraph people countries dying dont access clean water 
think important nsna able things years 
important motivate beneifical competition nations 
guess important earth important space 
example malaria deisase spread mosquito bites kill people africa 
people dont money medcine need 
goverment shouldnt need worry space right spending billion dollars year space 
like reason 
people smell poulition thats earth suffering 
need cleaner forms enegry power cars homes factories 
nearly half americans difficulty paying houses 
people street ether lost home stay 
goverment paying space stuff 
clearly dont people street 
think cool nsna 
able cool things 
example 1960 cold 
wanted spacecraft land 
article importance space exploration debates fund space exploration 
opinion author convinced space exploration desirable 
think fund space exploration expensive space exploration contributed medical field help reduce poverty hunger 
space exploration expensive actually total national budget 
compared national defense percentage 26.3 education isnt alot 
space exploration inexpensive contributed doctors 
article author explains nasa created medical instruments doctors learn humanbody reacts stress 
people face poverty hunger world today 
space exploration help reduce people dying starvation 
article importance space exploration explain satellites circle earth monitor lots land 
track measure conditions crops solid rainfall droughts 
means information help develop healthier nutrious crops feed people 
conclusion author convinced space exploration desirable inexpensive helps doctors reduce hunger poverty 
author convinced funding space exploration 
fund people living things plants able live 
somethings going come space kill human race 
people favor space exploration argue billion dollars problem 
happy people going space telling info whats happen maybe sure happen right 
agree funding space exploration money need space left overs people need money food housing medicine 
want convince people chance guts follow heart 
know americans problems food paying housing 
help 
space exploration gets billion dollars 
expect taking billion people need fund money time 
space exploration desirable needs earth 
needs earth hunger poverty housing food medicine pollution burning fossil fuels good effect space exploration 
problems tackled space exploration 
government spent billion dollars year space exploration 
people says 
comparing billion dollars spent national defense billion dollars spent renewable energy billion dollars helped live ways 
space exploration contribute area medicine 
nasa u.s. organization charge space program astronauts space check health body ensure safety 
medical treatments developed improved 
doctors learned human body 
nasa scientists developed better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting meet challenges 
improved quality life 
satellites track conditions crops coil rainfall drought 
conditions earth improve agriculture 
solve problem hunger 
space exploration desirable invented developed better things improve life 
helps medicine food 
contributes alot things 
article states convincing reasons space exploration agree space exploration allowed 
says budget spent education 26.3 'national defense space exploration 
unfortunate money space exploration education 
billion dollars national defense frankly 
space exploration gets billion difference billion dollars start realize space exploration looked national defense 
space exploration beneficial 
inspiring interesting upsides 
discoveries constantly space travel budget 
imagine larger budget 
limit 
space travel useful discoveries world poverty 
satellites moniter crops soil rainfall information improve lives distribution food 
space exploration improve life earth 
continue space exploration 
think helps money 
space exploration important 
reason continue explore space improve life 
improve life getting/being better medical better machine better food 
people money surely help money tell things space 
people money spent things 
billion dollars compared national defense spends 
reason stop wars 
stop wars people focus/ busy space benficial 
space exploring beneficial nasa allowed astronauts missions scientists ways monitor health stressful conditions 
people stop wars lessons right 
reason satellites circle earth monitor lots land 
track measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
information improve produce distribute food 
people agianst says nearly half americans alive dificulty paying housing food medicine point lives 
look crops crops price things foods prices 
people pollution burning gasoline warming ocean 
program develope clean energy viewed worthy investment 
disagree statement/ poin view/ position clean energy takes money going space 
going space helpful world picture 
going space helpful national budget 
space discovering ways better earth 
satellites monitor earth helpful wrong quickly 
ways improve problem having problem having people believe 
think space exploration desirable 
convinced opposing sides 
agree things needs accomplished earth space exploration useful time 
going start needs earth 
billion dollars help earth accomplish needs 
example prevent people africa malaria 
text started possible lower spread disease hanging large nets beds protect people bitten sleep 
nets cost people affect malaria afford nets 
shows people africa protected malaria 
billion dollars needs earth people affected malaria africa unlikely malaria 
example pollution 
spent billion dollars getting clean energy 
text says need cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
evidence shows billion dollars spent instead space exploration 
opposing good reasons 
solve human problems 
text said track measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
piece evidence shows space exploration useful 
improve food 
believe space exploration desirable 
author convinced fund space exploration 
example nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine point lives 
people need things able survive 
dying 
example fund space exploration people africa suffering malaria 
people africa prevent malaria medicine nets cover sleep 
money dollar items 
causing deaths 
reason author convinced earth polluted 
burn fossil fuels 
solved 
having program develop clean energy 
money 
cutting space exploration funds 
need cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
help prevent problems 
need money better things planet 
know things space sure learn 
people lives lost 
better world 
think space exploration 
think improve technology earth 
people better life earth 
people billion compared things spends budget 
actually total budget 
space exploration tangible benefits medicine 
space exploration develop ideas improve lives 
better exercising machines better airplanes better weather forcasting 
exploration helps learn human body stress develop medicine 
people spending money space exploration good thing 
money differently improve people lives space exploration improves people 
96.2 million americans live poverty 
malaria mosquito bites 
maybe space exploration easy cheaper getting malaria 
people poverty saids problems hunger 
satellites circle earth monitor land 
means farming area food distribution 
point space exploration 
hurt poverty helps 
people better technology better lives 
think stop exploration space 
focus instead focused important compared problems 
amazing discover deal 
know basic things space need 
problems earth obiously explore space thetime lets stay 
exploring space costs money 
money replenishing hunger people alive 
billion dollars money 
government money 
people live poverty world 
rocket launched steals money citizens 
agree space exploration better money nuclear bombs space money help stop 
believe people space benefitted space 
astronauts space come alive think good thing 
example text says scientists ways reaction stress 
stress earth 
things better exercise machines better weather forecasting better planes 
need things exercise tell weather order know going outside 
need airplanes world easier having sail boat longer time 
benefit space exploration track measure conditions crops soil rainfall drought 
satellites circle earth tell 
education improve space cold 1960 
probably smart invent things know math science 
space exploration benefits earth learn things visiting space 
fund space exploration space things 
like medical stuff technology weather forecast 
medical stuff medical instruments developed astronauts 
technology increased machines upgraded like better airplanes better exercise machines 
weather forecasts better accuracy weather 
know sunny 
believe space exploration helps earth 
said satellites examine lands good plant crops 
helps earth space 
fund space waste money 
explore space bigger problems earth 
lots problem 
world hunger global warming 
spend billion dolars 
ridiculous 
spending money people need help 
space things fund space programs 
belive space travel good idea 
cost things army 
space travel helped everyday life earth 
space travel enabled moniter crops 
know type food grow best 
farmers focus crops help crop making sure food avalible people 
large storm tell people save lives 
compaired army space travel gives 
secondly gives information medicine 
lift landing astronauts need release stress 
nasa discovered machien help relieve stress help people 
efficiant life support systems help people hospitals 
inventions save lives help average people stress 
thing space travel peaceful 
unlike army creat bombs kill millions space travel kill people 
space travel better 
tells space write 
writer exellpan writer tells things space 
writers wrong space food water house playground tree 
writer know saying thinks live space live space water tree playground food 
author article convice reasons gave reasonable 
like example help money space exploration help human people starving afford things need survive 
money student education 
education important life trust space exploration 
energy transportation faster better living space exploration people care lives survive 
think build space exploration think able learn stuff 
knowledge making higher technology 
higher tech better equipment earth able solar cars automatic stuff life happy maybe high stop disasters damaging stuff 
destroying buildings killing people 
maybe spaceship planet live live planet places 
attacked aliens high technology defend think technology chance surviving alien attack 
maybe stay space long maybe object power cars houses long time think fuel electricity 
space maybe wonder alien planet ship able work dominate beings universe 
planet live planet pretty small sure like 
mile planet torn apart buildings 
think continue space stuff think lower money year space 
like need high tech right 
maybe future better life problems 
think author convince space exploration good choice 
pros outweigh cons 
money spent space exploration look money spent national defence 
better people compete send people mars kill people 
process sending people space help medicine develop technology 
arguers money spent space exploration spent helping people actually space exploration people 
reading passage convinced fund space exploration 
believe help ways simply seeing universe 
previously scientists inadvertedly benefitted 
astronaut space need prepared 
scientists preping astronauts discovered things human body handled stress 
conditions launch return machines moniter health created 
process studying space travel things lives easier created 
helping train astronauts better exercise machines created 
help obesity epidemic country 
fixing kinks rockets better airplanes developed 
better airplanes traveling long distances dangerous 
track hazardous objects forcasting improved 
improvement accurate weather forecasts 
poverty hunger issues addressed 
satellites orbiting planet help moniter large amounts land time 
condition crops given people earth improve agriculture distribution 
space exploration threating showing superiority 
1960 american russia went cold instead bombing competed country travel moon 
disputes settled like ways colonize mars firing 
firmly believe explore space 
author passage convinced space travel best choice civilization 
advancements improvements result travels discover problems earth completely fixed 
1082_020079123 united states does'nt need spend billions dollars space 
need worry sick people people suffering 
scool money people food water 
shaelter africa people sick diseases becaue medicine money shelter 
people seffer disease called malaria 
kind like little animals 
dont want suffer need know nets 
nets capture animals

space exploration important nation 
argue sending rockets people space spending national budget fact average money spent space exploration budget 
things like national defence spends 26.3 money education uses budget according nasa 
spending fortune opposing countries vote explore things space national defense budget fund education 
important reason space exploration satalites objects space nasa benefit lives people 
cellphones satalites orbit earth 
satalites monitor multiple area earth help distribute resorces world 
final reason think space exploration whaste nasa contributes science health monitor effects different environment human body help invent airplanes advanced useful ones today 
life efficient nasa inovations 
overall national budget personal everyday live space exploration benefits society 
continue efforts explore unknown 
based information convinced space exploration funded considering fact earth 
people argue space exploration costly 
money spent compare budgets 
national budget 
money problem 
exploring space benefits 
example scientists better ways check stress humans 
astronauts need safe launching landing 
allowing improve area medicine 
lastly countries going hunger poverty satellites outer space contribute problem 
satellites clearly land earth including crops soil rainfall drought 
funding space exploration space help planet society 
conclusion space exploration shall funded costly helps improve area medicine helps poverty hunger planet 
billion dollars money national budject 
space exploration track measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
fund space exploration help solve problem earth 
space exploration important challenge motivation bring best ourself 
space exploration important motivate beneficial competition nations 
disagree need space exploration help author claimed money people space exploration 
need money shelter economy cause space exploration funding 
maybe exploration help planets help learn solar need focus home earth 
author claims need renewable thats true 
causing polution better type energy pollution inhabit world gone thing know 
thing author claims invest important things space 
lots money invested space exploration education hospitality 
economy investment space exploration 
space exploration help having satallites watch crops point crops people afford 
alot people world afford things possible alot pollution 
happening cause united states deciding spend money investment space exploration disagree authors claim space exploration important 
fund space exploration 
money spent space exploration renewable clean energy 
money clean energy help earth health explore earth 
46.2 million americans live poverty 
nearly half americans difficulty paying housing 
food medicine point lives 
true people afford supplies live 
americans poverty 
america help people poverty 
people need help 
earth suffering 
earth suffers careless people throwing trash floor polluting ocean 
people care earth 
space exploration good idea worth money 
people favor space exploration argue billion dollars 
billion money specificlly space exploration 
money spent environment usage exploration earth 
time want cleaner earth money exploring space 
author convinced space exploration desirable 
space exploration help scientists things space 
glaciers earth melting second space exploration helps planet survive 
space exploration helps scientists discover things earth prepared 
space exploration changes planets 
people hungry poverty think money u.s. spends national defense 
government spent 26.3 national budget national defense think need 
fund space exploration author persuade 
mind author persuasive points sides arguement 
n.a.s.a 
funded billion dollars thats entire national budget compared government spends education renewable energy national government 
people argue help earth people lethal disiesas countries 
sound selfish think countries help continent africa stop spread malaria funding nets 
nasa helps creates inventions better peoples lives excercise machines better aircrafts satellites improve weather forecasting 
obviously things bought money goes economy taxes 
nasa basically pays 
people argue ruin earth government finding cleaner ways replace fossil fuels 
billion dollars united states national budget renewable energy sources 
finally unknown exploration good thing 
imagine christopher columbus denied funding spain crossed atlantic america 
ignited competitive spirit western european countries 
sweden finland netherlands france spain england unknown land 
know common piece land unknown territory 
uncharted modern people 
competitive spirit lived president nixon wanted moon russian prime minister 
u.s. u.s.s.r. great race moon 
u.s. spirit lies dormont exploring space spirit 
fund nasa 
asteroid threats 
inventions bought function house-hold help economy 
great race nations participate 
space exploration good idea 
reading article believe space exploration allowed need tackle problems occured past years earth 
example 46.2 million americans live poverty 
main reasons space exploration planets similar earth spread human race 
abandon earth wreckage 
fitting best leave earth humans lived earth happy joyful 
pollution worry 
starving humans mere problem 
variety animals stayed original habitats 
thousand years later inventions started pouring troubles increase 
people greedy life changed 
started burning fossil fuels resulted harming oceans 
spend billion dollars year space exploration 
conclusion believe human race ready futher space exploration 
convince space money earth spent good like help families poverty starving families 
people dying everyday government knows arnet spending billion dollars going space savings lives 
reason shouldnt space money government save lifes second reason help prevent malariea people donating money buying nets beds reason better educational 
supplies equiptment schools 
students school enjoy 
agree author reading article space exploration instead bomb dropping airplanes 
think life important bomb dropping airplane strongly agree author space exploration important avoid human suffering 
benefits earth human wish strongly agree think 
think fund exploration money spen people need money like people africa malaria disease spread mosquito bites hilled somany people africa year 
people africa soffering mosquito bites people afford cost dallers 
people suffored malaria afford people ones affected traveling planet 
earth suffering becauas fuels gases gases polluting kids 
gases harming earth oceans farm ground ganna sticky ocean gunna covrd fish ganna 
fresh aresunna animul birds gunna caverd withe water gunna sink boottom ocean

space exploration desirable helpful human resources today discovery pause focus natural world 
said 46.2 million americans americans suffer poverty handling lives 
nearly half americans struggle payments need survive 
space exploration pent nearly million dollars national budget money people need help 
discoveries nasa space exploration programs usually helpful human resources damaging natural world live 
need advancements technology harms life improvements human life earth helped recovered difficulties 
instance people live africa high chance dieing malaria disease spread mosquitoes 
people africa escape struggle national budget spends money help provide people africa nets protected mosquitos 
national budget help sponsor scientists medical help help ways safer easier life africa benefit natural problem earth 
space explorations purposes goals researchers projects think wait natural world problems earth solved 
earth safer place living thing earth live suggest space exploration brought funded national budget 
human life important advancement technology pollutes earth think fund space exploration 
think spend money space exploration invent thing save earth 
live planet

people things need acouple dollers live space need money 
people need help earth suffering 
pollution buildings 
think money differently 
author makes good point making good arguement counter-arguement 
author points bunch critical evidence 
makes think 
think better support life funding space costs fortune 
space exploration ended waste money time 
think better focus things earth fails guess choice space exploration shot 
think author stated usually focus things real world problems think space exploration solve 
think best focusing earth space exploration 
think need 
spending money sending people nasa 
dont think spend 1,000.00 nets people afica 
people africa starving nasa send money instead spending money nasa sending space 
people proverty 
reason africa thousands places people water shelther food needed thing medicine

reason people getting sick spreading disease cured 
people sick dirty water drink 
pollution hurting land animals come surface fresh 
people homeless sick food pick ground trash 
crops destroyed weather people staruation 
earth hurt space exloration help 
scientists send satellites space check crops soil conditions 
space exploration ways produce food stop hunger 
weathers planets live 
scientists study space exploration possible space travel 
conclusion think space exploration important help scientists ways stop hunger 
advanced technology created money spent space exploration 
think fund space exploration 
reasons 
space exploration effects ocean clarity spend renewable energy space exploration 
need change money ocean protect earth 
poverty people cause rocket fired space exploration 
poverty people cost medicine mosquito bites 
people dying clean water space exploration 
water life dirty water 
finally space exploration money nonclear anymore people 
space exploration continue 
favor space exploration space exploration help different ways like help hunger poverty innovations improved lifes tangible benefits 
space exploration help hunger poverty satellites circle earth monitor lots land track measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
people information improve ways produce distribute food 
fund space exploration helping solve problem earth 
space exploration helps innovations improved like better airplanes better exercise machines better weather forecasting 
come technologies nasa egineers developed space travel possible 
finally space exploration helps tangible benefits like area medicine 
nasa allowed astronauts missions scientists monitor health 
ensure safe harsh conditions 
medical instruments developed doctors learned human body reaction stress 
favor space exploration space exploration help different ways like help hunger poverty innovations improved lifes tangible benifets 
perspective think author wanted tell people space exploration 
shouldent 
incase meteor comeing earth theres dangerous know know wither dangerous small poverty 
start getting better 
government supplies poor 
better funding nasa money 
think article 
space exploration funded suffering world fixed 
wasting like billion year billion year children africa help homeless help people need help 
billion making reusable source energy 
space exploration funded accurate weather accurate measurements crops disasters 
funded solved problem earth 
agree author exploring space 
think cost space program small compared costs

year spend billion dollars space exploration money change alot things happening earth 
money probaly stop malaria africa cost dollars 
hand feed poor people clothes 
huge problem global warming money clean energy homes cars factories 
text help africa stop malaria disease 
author puts good evidence sides huge assuement 
think author goes getting space exploration help problems earth instead exploring space 
like malaria disease putting global warming clean energy homes cars factories 
want exploring space instead helping earth 
green energy cars charge green 
ride bikes instead cars buses think 
ride bike school work lazy type people ride bard green energy trains instead getting traffic wont cost regular bike 
text says billion dollars create clean energy 
giving money toyota ford factories 
countries trying fund green energy clean cars 
people started bring debate 
word generation 
rockets building project cost alot money 
rocket release alot released 
adds global warming harm animals ways 
melt iceberg destroy elerr habitats 
global warming affect humans future 
money america problem 
help school roads forest polution medicine hunger 
space exploration help problems 
space travel include making sattelites sattelites tell storm like hurrican come people evacuate 
rockets building project cost money help problems 
author didnot convince paragraph said 46.2 million people problems earth 
said spent million dollars foplls 
help people sick problems spent million dollars space ships

people believe space exploration helps improve lives 
think money exploration desirable things money including helping 
46.2 million americans live poverty 
nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicien point lives 
people dying simple diseases cure simple solutions 
furthermore people countries dying access certain resources prevent spread diseases 
problems hunger poverty tackled satellites circle earth monitor lots land 
true satellites ability good monitor land help people 
people dying access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent diseases 
example malaria kills people africa year 
possible lower diseases hanging nets beds 
nets cost people affected malaria afford nets 
billion government uses space exploration help 
people support space exploration nasa trying ways monitor astronauts stress levels medical instraments developed doctors learned human body reaction stress helped doctors learn stress 
change fact people living poverty 
finally need cleaner forms energy cars homes factories 
earth suffering 
pollution burning fossil fuels harming oceans 
program develop clean energy worthy investment 
space exploration developed innovations better exercise machines airplanes better weather forecasting 
true inovations help people money earths environment people living poverty 
people space exploration important challenges motivations 
brings best 
statement true america bring best nation people living poverty people bring best 
conclusion believe space exploraiton desirable 46.2 million people living poverty 
people dying acess certain resources 
furthermore need cleaner forms energy 
billion gorverment spends spent improving ways energy help real people world 
reading article convinced space exploration desirable need earth 
reason nasa astronauts space scientists monitor health stressful conditions 
example maybe monitor health stressful conditions stressful conditions earth innovative 
article states innovations improved lives better exersice machines better airplanes better ways forecast weather 
important earth innovations helping earth 
reason human suffering avoided compete space races nations instead nations dropping bombs 
better playing races save lives danger brink 
maintain position space exploration 
persone okay want time dident 
want cool 
like kinda help 
dissagreed insted money studies space 
better schools gave money help notifications like books study supplies 
disagree think spend money space traveling 
reason live poverty 
author convinced explore space problems earth 
space exploration help 
like helped better forecasting airplanes exercise machines 
cost space exploration 
billion dollars national budget 
unlike national defense billion dollars 26.3 nation budget money spend defense instead money things 
space exploration good people 
helped doctors learn human body reaction stress 
believe space exploration halted better life earth 
cost space travel research space paying research renewable enrgy better transportation better medicine 
little send people machine space total cost space exploration total national budget 
billion dollars research medicine stop pollution 
exploration space actually helped ways like medience compared money innovate planes communication 
46.2 million americans suffering hunger money things like 
people argue exploration place like earth inhabitable planets habitable extremely away 
send people planets half 
sending people planets like mars useless machines human place 
billion dollars save lives correctly 
conclusions believe money things like research medicine 
costs space travel education things sent space help people earth 
believe space exploration payed money space exploro running reasons space exploration payed money 
know national budget 
think alot president money homeless homeless shelter people disagree thinks space exploration payed alot becase scientist work hard payed alot researching single 24/7 feel wrong becaus president 
billion company nasa 
think stop space exploration think waste money help people improve hospital supplies 
half americans afford food water shelter 
gasoline harming enviroment 
money improve life life easier earth 
belive stop space exploration money help heal people 
population earth dropping harm diseases 
money food water given people need 
agree fuel 
different energy like solar power instead moons reflecting light 
think moons light reflection 
solar power work 
couple reasons space exploration helps money help life earth 
space exploration helpful think health earth important 
think 
people hungry everyday 
countries people dying 
access clean water 
malaria disease spread mosquito bites kill people africa year 
'yes 'the importance space exploration article gave insight benefits flaws funding space exploration

national budget uses billion dollars space exploration problems earth 
issue important affects nation budget spent 
opinion think problems earth explore worlds slowly dying 
million americans live poverty 
people homes jobs food clothing 
simple thing little money 
create jobs people affort things need 
people working space exploration people poverty probably high school education meet requirements math science 
pollution burning fossil fuels harming oceans 
release space toxic gases released 
cars factories machinery fossil fuels cause pollution right 
giving renewable energy billion dollars compared billion dollars giving space exploration 
finally people countries dying access clean water medical care necessities life easily aquired 
people africa dying malaria disease spread mosquito bites easily prevented nets cost 
people creates better understanding math sciene

space exploration important activity 
brings advances technology time 
space exploration brings scientific knowledge year 
people argue money spent disagree 
cold 1960s instead trying kill countries tried explore moon 
example human lives spared space exploration 
space exploration help people earth 
technology satellites check crops grow condition soil rain 
astronauts sent spaceships advances medicine sure okay 
help people 
overall believe space exploration worthy investment united states

space exploration inprove excersise machines airplanes weather forecasting 
space exploration provide ideas upgrade machines uses money 
secondly american citizens live proverty 
encluding countrys 
half americans diffculty paying food housing medicine 
money help need 
example malaria diesease cause mosquito bites 
year people africa malaria 
prevent hanging nets beds 
nets cost dollars afford 
money buying nets 
space lovers propose cure space 
space cure money 
simple donate money nets 
addition space equiments uses fossil fuels harm earth 
rockets space uses fossil fuels 
trips forth harm earth 
solution problem space 
afford pollute earth cure 
finally scientist says space exploration important earth 
disagree statement/point position going space harms earth help heal need 
nineteen million dollars wasted space million energy renewal 
think space exploration pollutes earth 
money need 
going space develop equipment pollute earth 
help earth time 
space exploration important helping earth need 
opinion space exploration opinion believe space exploration mandatory 
reasons 
alot polution rocket fuel 
damage atmosphere rocket fuel polute 
helpless adults children dying hunger 
parents older syblings skip meals younger ones 
africa alot people malaria 
dasease given mosquitos 
nets help prevent 
problem people afford 
lastly alot poor schools

money nets people need protection malaria 
space exploration totally thing 
helped alot especially technology department 
think 
technology improve lives helping people planet 
things budget 
example national defence takes billion budget 
budgets extra profit 
thing 
probly people feel treated unfair 
like taking causes profit 
conclusion better money budget 
thing space exploration help instead focusing space help causes 
space exploration desirable makes strive better technologies scientific knowledge 
better technology nasa allowed astronauts missions scientists ways monitor health stressful conditions 
medical instruments developed 
scientific knowledge rising meet challenges space exploration nasa scientists developed innovations improved lives 
arguement exploration desirable 
needed earth think space exploration continued 
investment space helps improve technology earth help track measure conditions food billion dollars spent government 
space exploration help human technologies 
years space exploration human improved lives 
better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
space exploration people earth 
technologies space exploration gaved help tackle problem hunger poverty 
track measure conditions food rain fall soil 
people improve food know going 
support space exploration helping earth community 
takes little better life 
billion dollars government 
spend little money right support space exploration thing thing learned technologies bring better community 
helpful earth 
belive space exploration project needs practiced 
fact earth needs help means need space people planet provide 
space look history billions years 
belive americans jobs completely shut nasa imagine people loose jobs 
personally know people willing open business space planet dreams come true raise income maybe americans debt happen second 
issue requires little national budget benefits spend national defense barely 
economy struggling people businesses planets higher taxes support earth 
earth gets money defeantly need

helping americans kind money throwing away space exploration 
author says article scientists believe pollution burning fossil fuels gasoline harming oceans 
money clean home planet 
want breathing large amounts gasoline 
know 
certain benefits space exploration feel money especially large amounts like needs spent saving place live 
article states countries people dying access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
world come 
wants families poor things need survive 
author states like people africa dying malaria disease spread mosquito bites people afford special prevent malaria 
earth perfect problems costs space exploration deal 
unfortunately earth falling apart government needs 
conclusion government needs saving space exploration money save earth 
space exploration help earth ways government needs worry people living earth 
true earth problems come space exploration 
people opposite opinion 
like price space exploration 
true help family soon homeless 
choice decide 
reading article believe space exploration stop 
reason money spent differently improve people lives

think people dieing 
want help 
purpose space exploration 
lots people argueing think 
fund space exploration 
think space exploration maybe studied little actually like said sattelites spot crops growing grow 
sattelite land fertile plant crops feed people poverty 
plant herbs stuff provide medicine 
expand research space technology able create improve everyday lives 
think fund space exploration 
help discover planets stars lots things discover space 
sattilites help pictures earth 
space exploration provides things discover space 
maybe life planets 
second nasa help building technology earth 
people affecting earth problem 
nasa help watching weather form sattilites warn wrong 
track crops soil rainfall droughts 
discover days maybe hours 
finally good compete russia moon 
long time cold agreed race moon prove better 
better dropping bombs airplanes kill people 
improve life earth
