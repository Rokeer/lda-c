important satellites circle earth monitor lots land 
finally finish saying fund space exploration helping solve problems earth 
funding space exploration required task united states finding maybe smallest piece extra terrestrial life mars 
combine forces russia 
space race having alot advantages technology 
thats combine forces super carrier start going distant planets problems people saying money space exploration better things like helping africa 
neighbors help weve helped help 
like small city moon advances exploration start contacting alien life help friendly

satellites built monitor things 
easier track food resources makes easier produce food certain place people longer suffer hunger 
help people food resources longer need suffer hunger 
undecided need live place earth need study place live 
right earth endanger exploding money spent cheaper things instead rocket like half tossed space

reason dung space exploration earth maybe people diseases 
like africa people malaria disease spred mosquito bites 
people africa afford dollar bite 
second reasons fund space exploration money cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
things polluting ocean 
poullt plants polluted harm people sick 
reason money things 
whats point exploring space 
money things earth

cost national budget going space benefits-i think getting space better helps earth 
space exploration budget nation budget 
space exploration budget 25.1 national defence budget education budget 
space exploration cost worry 
space exploration helped earth stuff like medication 
example doctors help astronauts stress problems 
know cure stress 
building rockets people know construct better planes cars 
space exploration helps earth 
helping earth going helping earth process getting 
created better things 
help 
benefits going 
problem gives benefits

thanks technology invented 
possible walk moon 
earth going filled people malaria 
mosquito bite 
live africa 
people waste money space/rocket ships 
money nets 
secondly money help people house 
finally money making water clean 
money nets cost 
texts says malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
protects getting bite sleeping 
nets cost people effected malaria afford nets agree people dies malaria diseases gone 
reason flawed people dies mosquito start diseases 
secondly money helping people houses 
text says nearly half americans difficulty paying housing 
people house need house protect snowstorms raining weathers 
agreee space rocket help tell spmething gping land earth 
objection helps people dying house shelter people getting asteroids 
finally money help ocean clean hiring people want money cleaning ocean 
texts says country people died clean water 
need water drink water 
people agree world water dirty like 
strongly disagree living earth need care

author convince explore space 
know tempeture time explore whats going happend know going cold bring wear sweater bring sweater 
crops grow hungry hungerness 
good didnt tech energy power wouldnt face phone dont lights fall dont homework play games phones important 
case emergency 
dont energy thoes things 
people need energy things like food cars 
good spends billion dolars education better paying education people going streets gangs education going life 
believe space program 
space exploration help medicines technology help moniter crops weather satellites friendly competition amougst countries 
space program advancement medical field grow slower 
example astronaut goes space scientists doctors earth moniter astronaut health 
advancing technology advanced results space scientists opportunities improve life earth 
secondly satellites placed space allows people stay touch moniter crops 
monitering crops soil farmers informed type foods grow current season 
lastly prevent countries declaring greater strength 
example instead having giant america russian race space shuttle moon fastest 
conclusion believe united states close nasa space program positive things space exploration 
reading artical convince explore space people starve 
article point billion dollars year space exploration 
people think monny spent intisly help heat people earth 
think spended monny explor space 
think traveling space waste time 
people dieing malaria africa 
people 
like right know maybe dieing malaria family nets money going fund spaceship rocket going space looking planets stars 
people away nets people need dieying blame little life 
think free 
protect little life 
sense 
dont 
appreciate 
reason traveling space waste time people difficulty paying rent paying food 
money thier paying unnessecery stuff like rockets spaceships 
money building houses homeless people family having trouble rent want house leased room family mansion small house little money 
food little money 
like spend money need survive 
choosing space traveling waste money people contrys need money 
space traveling wasting money people spend billion dollars space ships 
spending money like tomorrow 
want diffrent planet wait 
people spending money rocket spaceships 
reason people spending money spacesphips rockets 
spending billion dollars spaceships rockets like 
money 
money need spent medicine cure desieses like cancer cure cancer moon important stuff 
like people dieing people buying billion rockets spaceships having rides little girl dying 
think reason good great 
stop space traveling spend money important stuff 
time money wisely 
like 
seriously billion dollars 
thats smart spending money spaceship rocket 
people need money cures like cancer stuff like 
persuade 
appreate listen 
think funding space exploration 
like passage states billion total national budget 
current issues space exploration helpful monitoring land improve produce distribute food 
space exploration improved lived today 
example cell phone satellites space 
space exploration lets people technology improving 
instead spending fourth budget national defense small help prevent diseases malaria help solve problems world 
space exploration helped improve technology areas medical help better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
space worth money 
author convince space exploration worth money helping cure diseases destroy hunger 
think worth national budget money nets need 
help going space exploring planets 
exploring space priority helping earth people 
possible lower spread disease hanging large nets beds protect people bitten sleep 
afford nets national budget solve problem 
solar-powered cars need 
cars world poluted 
help world polutes world good earth 
space exploration avoid human suffering bombing 
imagine human avoided nations competed planet exploring spaceships instead bomb-dropping airplanes 
problem hunger proverty tackled space exploration 
exploring planets priority helping earth people 
money save people earth space exploration helps avoid bomb-dropping planes 
conclusion space worth money 
position space exploration theres stuff needs earth 
reason things earth 
thing people help earth instead space million government gives space exploration spend heal people help injuris deseases infections sickness things kill 
people 
thing help earth africa kids parents people deseases cause mosquito bites 
desease called maleria 
maleria kill alot people 
people year cause 
moskitos away kids sleeping 
nets cost people acfected maleria canot afford nets

support matter problems like hunger clothing shelter jobs right medical care help people diseases 
president eisenhower agrees matter says hunger poverty hitting fast dont need space-craft 
cold space race russia compete moon 
gives clue doesnt spaceships break atmosphere burn fossil fuels isnt helping earth 
u.s. fund trillions dollars important needs survive example education billion dollars

fixed space-crafts focus main points 
reading article believe space exploration allowed 
reason medical instruments developed doctors learned human body reaction stress 
important doctors learn human body 
reason nasa scientists developed innovations improved lives includes better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
important improve technology weather forecasting 
article states problems hunger poverty tackled space exploration 
thats important help tackle hunger poverty 
finally believe space exploration continued 
believe space exploration 
reasons people dying starvation 
government money rocketships space uses 
article 'the importance space exploration states 'nearly half americans difficulty paying housing food medicane point lives 
'today seen people streets eating scraps food thats left ground 
second reason people dying diseases 
article 'the importance space exploration states 'for example malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
possible lower spread disease hanging large nets beds protect people bitten sleep 
nets cost people affected malaria afford nets 
malaria dangerous government stop money space exploration people dying 
reason earth suffering

space exploration 
space exploration 1950 
believe stop funding space exploration come long telescope starry night 
reason wonder billion dollars national budget world 
help small businesses develop fund researchers poor endless 
reason pollution rocket 
skies breathe mean billion dollars spent making flying rocket caused 
fossil fuels rocket released 
basically spending money kill 
reason think parts small shuttle leaves atmosphere 
mean know goes think parts float space cause orbits rockets 
happen billion dollar rocket gets wasted older rocket 
saying funding kind misused 
reasons given states billion dollars poverty fossil fuel rocket released missing flying parts earth orbit

opinion author convince fund space exploration 
think benefited space exploration 
news satelites space 
weather reports satelite space 
like author stated national budget space exploration 
little compared 26.3 national budget uses national defense 
sure problems earth solve people helping improve 
like africa people doneting nets protect people catching malaria 
conclude people working solve problems earth 
national budget goes space exploration 
benefits space satelites 
space exploration funded 
author convince funds space exploration 
think people important space exploration 
people africa access clean water medication help cure diseases 
people study space exploration 
opinion spend quarter space exploration people struggling poverty 
people africa dying disease called malaria afford avoid mosquito bites 
space explorers billion dollars tool thousand nets money exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting important 
think billion dollars year spent space exploration better spent 
maybe space explorers explore money space exploration interesting valuable spending money education poverty 
schools needing better textbooks 
classrooms need remodeling 
stated text billion dollars spent education compared billion spent national defense u.s. sure space exploration national defense gave billion money poverty 
greatly help 
people poverty poor 
half daily 
survive dollar maybe maybe 
gave person poverty lessening poverty 
solving malaria problem people africa 
saying space exploration nice 
reading article feel like funding space exploration program benefit 
benefit improving technology 
advanced technology help cures diseases prevent people dieing 
create better working safer machines people 
example people lost figure better machine free stuck wheelchair 
benefits forcasting weather 
weather forcast 
doubt alive 
helps telling theres tsunami meteor coming 
basically warning prepare nature offer 
support idea feel like saved lifes save lives help improve economy 
disagree continue space exploration 
cost visit space 
acceptable travels space costed costs trip 
billion dollars lesser budget education mean money 
space 
intresting stuff astronauts time discover space 
writting says rocket fired theft citizens suffered hunger proverty 
thats explanation hunger proverty 
space travel 
maybe continue space exploration 
costs citizens 
maybe exploring space priority needs earth 
earth 
people care planet live space examine things 
late space 
anytime worry earth 
think author good showing space exploration good idea author showed examples good thing 
example exploring space making instraments help helping 
weather recorders monitors health issues today 
example author good point flew ships robots space provided tons knowledge education teaching younger things science math 
making interested maybe eventually space scientist 
example lots people spend money important things 
money alot space exploration 
like education making clean energy giving food people need 
example pretty important cold russia 
pushed knowledge able teach things younger geneation questions space keeping busy striving knowledge making smarter better country 
spend alittle money space exploration good thing 
things money nasa effects helps better earth plants unknown 
space exploration worth huge amounts money u.s. government spends year 
huge contreversary think help society advanced believe government save money help poverty 
personally think benefit longrun spend money 
spend money space ships send satalites space 
monitor food growth analyze grow crops 
second look storms incoming weather 
lastly test airs temperature analyze climate change frequent changing 
second money spent space exploration helping life earth 
develop friendly ways energy ways pollution 
donate orphanages poverty american countries 
possibility spend money sending sollders home famlly againn 
saying space exploration benefits 
planets resources need earth 
earth humans able live moon planet 
lastly space technology advance medicine cure different diseases 
space exploration 
true expensive helps medicine gather resources dont 
leave space exploration disagree dont money spend cause send space exploration trips frequently 
money advancementes getting poverty 
getting completely isnt good advance things space tech 
think fund space exploration billion spend space ending things like hungar poverty 
think spending money important things like education disease 
46.2 million americans poverty nearly half americans trouble paying housing food medicine 
billion help people 
half america food medicine important person life 
education suffering 
government spends billion dollars education think 
public schools country education important 
school districts money billion spent education 
need focus educating young space later 
people africa suffers diseases like malaria 
malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people 
nets prevent cost people afford 
money space exploration saving people diseases 
overall think spend money space exploration 
people suffer hungar poverty disease 
spend money instead 
spend money education teaching young help country better smarter 
fund space exploration 
help thing planted like example mission comes docter happen body work different came space 
importent reason live better like better airplane better weather forecasting 
agree space exploration desirable needs earth 
good things learn space 
stay earth help better 
space maybe help earth 
happened problem solved 
argue budget money helping earth 
reasons agree fund space exploration scientists learn human body stress nasa technology benefits going space earth 
think technology said passage help instead poverties 
reason money spacecraft spacesuit technology 
billion dollars national budget 
rest bugdet argue 
think space exploration important benefit lives 
billion dollars total national budget 
space exploration help learn technologies possibly help earth 
think stop space explorers trying things 
space exploration truly desirable space exploration desirable needs earth 
think desirable 
president eisenhower said rocket fired theft citizens 
theft citizens greater return 
sure america live poverty wile billion dollars spent space research national budget 
sure research focus solely buying medicine poor funding program develope clean energy doctors developed lots medical equipment helping space research 
thanks nasa scientists space explorations developed better exercise machine planes weather forecasting sake people living earth time space research allows students learn 
space science 
humans naturally competitive compete planet-exploring bomb-dropping airplanes 
certainly choose attacks poverty attacks innocent living creature 
easily rocket fired theft citizens greater better trade possibly wish 
space exploration desirable needs earth 
question controversial well-debated author convince desirable necessary 21st century science- 
start particular article wondering argument paragraphs stood strong fact space exploration laid ground work inventions improvents 
example nasa improving airplanes-a much-needed travel source enables giants paly games road obama meeting presidents rulers world 
example invention nasa layed groundwork exersise machines risingly important aspect american life obesity rates rise 
finally nasa plays important vital role weather forecasting necessary francisco degrees thursday degrees today 
argument author included national budget precisely agree-its billion dollars 
understand targeted 98.8 compleately ignored money spend poverty hunger globe 
finally nasa helped doctors develop cutting-edge technology measure bodies reaction stress 
especially vital takeoff 
touchdown 
pressure puts exessive stress body 
conclusion author convince space exploration desirable- know whatt 
author convince space exploration good 
convinced author stated reasons space exploration help solve earth problems 
author said space exploration helped medicine helped better exercise machines airplanes weather forecasting 
pretty good reasons exploring space helpful 
satellites circle earth help hunger problem 
satellites monitor land tracking measuring crops rainfall soil drought 
think space exploration helpful 
dissagree space discovery continued 
dissagree article states right government spends billion dollars year space exploration 
think spending money space exploration price reduced spend soving planet 
article states percent americans poverty 
spending billion trying create jobs decrease number americans poverty 
reason disagree fossil fuel 
think spend money stopping fuel plants creating clean energy electric cars 
author states people ones need help earth needs help 
think money service projects picking garbage 
think vote tobacco free 
reason earth dying 
couple reasons dissagree probably money 
obviously debt china countries going debt 
money helping africa 
article states africa suffering malaria comes mosquitos 
lower prices nets 
space 
final frontier 
dare explore stay familiar home earth solve current problems 
explore galactic surroundings cowards prove 
problems earth minor exploration lies ahead 
advance species need explore space 
reasons sapport exploration come advancements support type non-bloody 
resources disposal lying 
text opposite page said space exploration 'tangible benefits scientists finding ways monitor astronauts health stressful conditions great achievement 
advances technology include advances physical health advances travel advances meterology 
innovations allow human race advanced lead benefits earth 
advance space head 
advancements space earth people earth 
technology stay help 
innovations gifts giving 
cold like text said 'united states russia competed greatness race explore space 
wanted land spacecraft moon visit planets 
type warfare like competing shop employee month 
spend time cleaning shop competitor improves services 
things benefit shop simile world 
type warfare spend billion dollars 26.3 national budget spent defences warfare space exploration benefit knowledge tear countries 
type warfare things like hiroshima bomb holocaust happened 
instead people living mars write response literature/persuasive essay 
niche space exploration better 
text previous pages says money spent space exploration national budget things like warfare heavily spent 
money technology willpower explore space binding factor ties earth 
restraing exploring space hinder race species limit knowledge minimum extent 
instead best explore galaxies lies world 
question 
shall 
author convince agree space fund 
nice things saying happen funded space exploration people suffering space solve things 
examples 
people africa malaria 
help donating 
hand funding space help people malaria 
going space wathing weather earth save people africa 
donating dollars protect better saving life person 
going space help people target mosquitos sleeping 
secondly giving money people space explor uses feul exit earth mospher uses space 
instead fund money help earth 
example gass cars awhile time 
release feul earth uses protect self 
everybody drives second layer protecting earth layer 
caps melting happening flood earth 
left land earth 
lastly people losing homes feed families self 
donate help people need 
better funding going space report things raidio/ news helping people lose lost thing 
conclusion fund science program money donate people realy need 
example people africa need nets people suffering lost people save enviorment natural causes like tusami earthquake japan global warming caps 
space exploration belivie explore space love science 
helped alot like medicine health care 
right facing economical nature crysis ozone depleting search place live 
astronomy help planet need sooner later 
know cost 19.7 billion dollers compared spendings 
people oppose 
need spend money 
truth turning 
families electric cars alot people basic provisions 
story 
think fund space exploration important reasons 
facts article people suffer hunger poverty money 
fact americans trouble paying house food medicine 
facts people 
reason funding space exploration 46.2 million americans live poverty 
americans afford paying houses food medicine life 
people countries money purchase clean drinking water medical care solutions stop spread diseases 
example malaria disease caused mosquito bites 
africans solution hang large nets beds sleep 
problem people malaria afford nets cost 
second statement funding space exploration earth suffering 
pollution burning fossil fuels like gasoline changing oceans 
need better form energy power cars home factories earth suffering 
people money space exploration help earth suffering gasoline 
people space exploration help earth suffering 
space exploration help earth stop suffering long 
people exploring space earth suffer gasoline power cars homes factories 
takes months years solution earth suffering 
conclusion think stop funding space exploration solve problems 
problems solve putting people poverty hunger money 
problem solve buying large nets africa lower death rate 
reasons think stop funding 
support space exploration 
cares 
remain neutral position 
think people space needed 
reason need adventure 
adventure needed human soul 
essentially happens senses unknown locations 
reason commotion communists avoided 
ussr communist 
cold gone nuclear weapons great countries zeroed 
space hopefully prevent 
reason tech improves time 
bring items trinkets space 
means need change thesis 
need space exploration 
disagreement funding space exploration long time 
believe lower funding space exploration instead money people poverty protect earth 
government spends billion dollars year space exploration jjust small percentage national fund help people poverty 
believe space exploration important improving poverty 
exploring focusing objects space think taking care 
space exploration costly adding pollution earth 
people think funding space exploration beneficial believe helpful developement science math technology 
true think advancements people poverty benefit money 
think funding space exploration completely stop 
think nation wanting explore space

benifital earth oxygen space craft search places oxygen inriched planets 
spend billion dollars 
lead technological advances elemants cure diesese 
spend money space exploration 
disagree idea putting money space exploration alot people care space 
need money mapntane earth 
look people africa 
suffering majority aids 
instead wasting money space exploration invest money important things 
anther thing rocket space alot smoke causes pollution health 
conclusion space exploration care space cool invests alot money 
money industries selfish 
alot sick people afford medarine need money important things maintane earth 
think money space exploration 
think waste money 
billion dollars homeless people africa 
matter national budget 
46.2 million americans living proverty 
half people afford housing food medicine lives 
countries dying disease clean water medical cave simple solutions prevent diseases 
example malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
possible nets 
nets protect people getting bitten sleep 
nets cost dollars 
people money afford 
people need help earth 
scientists believe pollution burning fossil fuels harming ocean 
need cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
program develop clean energy worthy investment 
reasons billion dollars instead space exploration 
personally think fund space exploration important funds cancer public safety 
space exploration exactly today society relys subjects mentioned 
believe space exploration somewhat importance think funding important matters bigger topic 
focus present better future explore outer space 
fund important topics like aids prevent problems create window oppunities continue space exploration important things need attention 
convicned outer space imporve live earth 
space predict weather billion dollars little budget 
left money poperty 
problem earth investigate earth important daily life 
know earth know planets planet 
think government waste money poor people people dying 
suffering hunger thist 
government alot attention poverty people 
care space stuff helping earth

things solve immediate problems 
invest long-term benefits 
conclusion author half convinced fund space exploration 
total waste money like president eisenhower said rocket fired theft citizens suffered hunger poverty 
author convince space exploration desireable needs earth americans living poverty million people 
thing justify claim wasting money space exploration 
americans took steps moon accomplished 
instead spending money space travel better earth like finding cleaner forms energy cars homes factories 
launch spaceship releases smoke good planets 
government spending billion dollars people opponets claim think money 
example millions people suffering hunger 
instead government wasting precious money difference planet 
world hunger homeless shelter 
wasting money space exploration 
kids suffering america different countries 
world hunger world 
stand non-polluted environment world hunger 
currently nasa exploring mars life mars 
government investing money space exploration question need money current purpose 
think different uses money space exploration 
reason contend money purpose americans living poverty 
46.2 million americans living poverty 
americans 
americans trouble paying housing food medicine 
money going nasa 
reason support thesis fact countries spread disease 
instance disease malaria 
malaria disease spread mosquitoes 
money space exploration thousands thousands nets protect people specifically africa sleep bitten mosquitos 
solve millions lives 
lastly money space exploration discovering ways reduce pollution 
scientists believe pollution burning fossil fuels gasoline harming oceans 
money government spending forms energy fuel cars homes factories 
money space exploration develop program improve oceans 
conclusions need uses money government uses space exploration 
useful future things need dealt earth 
priorities decide right extra money

author convincing space exploration issue 
gives good ideas achieved 
ourself 
possible poverty cures 
space exploration better exercise machines space advancing technology 
think having long term goal space exploration outweighs benefits today immediate problems 
ending ourself save precious earth devastion repair 
impact power nuke destroy country 
space exploration friendly approach 
instead nations battling moving 
space exploration species totally enemy face 
finding enemy bond nation closer prove rewarding coming countries 
space exploration poverty definite advance medicine 
poverty nasa able planet resources

space exploration advance medicine astronauts need medicine alive case danger 
traveling space advance technology greatly 
nations competing space benefit 
benefit wile nations compete race better technology heightens 
technology gain help earth 
history people looked wondered 
people fought spent lifetimes trying answer people want throw away chance 
people need research earth start learning space 
need better medicine food cleaner power 
obviously people ignorant scientific advancements nasa 
biggest reasons explore space research medicine food growth 
space ships built increasingly efficient power 
food yield grown better medicine developed 
people understand thing fighting 
outraged suggestion think money given nasa 
think money space exploration change lives making easier live earth ways 
motivate bring best making stuff know ideas people 
motivate beneficial competition example 1960 competition russia called cold 
stuff seen 
billion dollars national budget 
billion 26.2 spent national defense 
billion spent education billion spent renewable clean energy 
satelite circles earth monitor land example track measure crops soil rainfall drought 
help produce better foods like veggies grain 
support making exercise machines people lose weight easier life making better plane safe flight better weather forecasting weather tell accurate weather right 
thesis choose spend money space billion dollars percent national budget barely budget discover stuff space 
reading article believe space exploration desirable needs earth 
reason 'over 46.2 million americans live poverty 
means money space exploration help people poverty 
reason need cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
means need invest cleaner energy

opinion space exploration funded right 
piece evidence text speaks americans poverty half american population struggling living fees lifetime 
concern united states like space travel going bring money jobs people need 
goes 
single trip space requires expensive rocket ship fuel thousands gallons time 
writer text speak costs trip equipment requires 
second enviorment good shape eihter 
fuel pollution problem rockets shooting space 
writer left rockets different materials toxic materials create 
stuff space help save enviorment rely space life problems global warming earth shoulders 
becycling reducing waste riding bicycles help repair earth takes authority happen 
people afford bicycles thanks post money-wasting space explorations 
space exploration makes creative creative preserving world future generations 
people africa starving unable obtain cheap protect malaria afford precious minerals stripped space exploration 
satellite watch crops growth plants food 
satellite mean homeless starving people 
author writing tell help starving people poverty 
think space exploration gotten having real effect earth 
like like space exploration necessity 
sure good scientific reasons earth needs protecting people/animals inhabited 
writer good explaining help people/animals inhabited able persuade 
think fund space exploration need space exploration someother places like malaria need funds/money nets 
need nets malaria people afford cost 5.00 
think space exploration diserable planet earth need education renewable cleaned energy national defense 
funds divide groups need money example donations different places afford medicines clothes supplies 
people dies diseases example coldness mosquitoes bites tother tragic disease 
money/fund activities extra funds left extra space exploration 
diserable space exploration 
explore galaxy rigs textures planets visited moon times money/funds need societys communities 
money belongs government incharge correctly 
encourage people help donating money funds donate needed items like clothes technology possible 
help spreading 
finally think right funds 
think space exploration open times year save money 
think article said going space true earth explodes world planet 
evidence planet live 
second evidence live bigger planet 
evidence good live longer 
wasting billion dollars putting satellite sending people space 
spending billion dollars sending people space spend medioation education better homes 
waste billion dollars space people need money dieying diesieses food 
care sending people space 
america shouldnt fund money space travel theres people hungry 
theres homeless people spending billions money space travel 
spend money making houses homeless people 
hungry people food live years 
america charity funding people hunger people pain 
explore space needs earth 
think 
reasons space exploration planet 
space exploration expenses huge 
billion dollars year space exploration billion dollars alot 
people starving days 
like africa 
money food 
billion dollars food maybe year 
wasteing money space exploration instead helping starving people earth shameful 
secondly point wasteing billion dollars look stars planets skies telescopes 
telescopes help look 
afford billion dollars space trip telescopes cheaper 
lastly rocket fuel help planet 
gives alot polluted oxygen 
sure trees rocketship huge 
takes alot fuel 
scientists believe fuel burning fossil fuels harming oceans 
harming fresh oceans 
polluted gases liquids gets oceans harm water creatures 
creatures fish feed 
land animals eats fish creatures 
underwater creatures dead land creatures tasteing food 
favorite food fish 
conclusion think going space exploration terrible enviornment 
land creatures 
wasteing money explore space look telescope space 
telescopes cheaper going space 
gives pollution stop space exlploration

funding space exploration cost imediate cost billion dollars 
billion dollars total national budget like alot better purposes 
year u.s. spends billion dollars national defense 26.3 national budget billion dollars spent education national budget billion dollars spent renewable energy 
difference funds space exploration funds funds need 
second money currently space exploration help hunger poverty 
half americans difficulty paying housing food medicine point lives 
countries people easy access neccessities like clan water

people idea think clear discovering things 
world space exploration 
space exploration desirable needs earth saving lives limited time exploring space time exist 
humans people poverty help money exploring space 
initially thought space exploration worth problems earth 
reading article caused second-thoughts thought 
investing space exploration beneficial exponential money needed 
worth risk 
instead helping poverty needs less-fortunate 
author tried convince space exploration telling benefits gotten result space travel 
best example satellite dependent satellite unaware need communication weather broadcasting unable advantage satellite 
space exploration yield positive results okay ignore pain suffer 
think carelessly invest space exploration strive solve immediate needs people earth screaming 
think space stuff save earth space 
clean beach help people 
care earth 
help care people dying 
people africa hurt mosquitos bites 
scientists believe pollution burning fossil fuels harming oceans 
example malaria disease spread mosquito bites kills people africa year 
save people earth 
problems paying bills housing food medicine point lives 
according article main idea space program going 
theirs reasons reasons 
picked cancel program 
reason cancell program parts world finacial problems 
finacial problem stop space programs 
space program takes alot money schools people homeless charity 
budget space exploration 
think government continue funding space explorations 
government helps people live poverty 
people live poverty welfare checks 
chance school learn 
decision succeed 
second budget space exploration national budget 
billion dollars 
compared billion dollars 26.3 government spends national defense 
people help africa 
possible meet everybody africa 
people helped feel terrible forever 
conclusion space explorations funded 
help world 
people earth everyday hunger diseases 
think good idea paying people space people earth suffer poverty earth needs money space 
think people earth suffer everyday hunger diseases affor medicine 
think people need money prevent death children people money exploring space nets prevent diseases malaria caused mosquito bites buying nets people 
money afford 
save lives helping people nets 5.00 
reason earth needs money alot poverty going earth think money better help prevent poverty people save peoples lives instead 
wasting money explore space 
thousands people everyday need food diseases water help people prevent poverty earth better place instead money people explore space 
earth better place help better planet billion dollars space exploration 
prevent pollution oceans caused gasoline earth suffers 
space exploration allowed 
total national budget positive education instead violent negative lilce army spending billion dollars 26.3 national budget 
space exploration program nasa educational better 
space program build spend satellites space 
satellites cell phones internet modern 
satellites information crops droughts soil rainfall accurate maps 
reason space programs medicinal 
going space changes bodies adopt 
space program focused 
space programs lack modern technology advancement science today america 
think article inspired space explorations think good chance learning diffrent planets 
world seen close 
earth lives 
cool journey diffrent planets 
plus going space 
nasa went space scientist developed ideas 
better machines better space crafts better forcasting says article

instead space exploration 
think space exploration 
space exploration controversial topic 
space exploration good 
uses money gives useful ideas 
believe space exploration beneficial people earth bundle reasons investment space exploration good scientists study 
text says scientists ways monitor astronauts health stressful conditions 
astronauts explored space developed medical instruments monitor bodies stressful conditions 
according text nasa scientists developed better exercise machines better weather forecasting better airplanes technologies nasa engineers developed space travel possible 
space exploration technologies 
secondly space exploration tackled problems hunger poverty 
evidence shown text says satellites track measure conditions crops soil rainfall drought 
people earth information improve produce distribute food 
funding space exploration seriously stop problems earth 
argue billion dollars plenty cash space funds 
money directly stop problems 
budget 
long term sucess short term 
maybe leave earth need information space 
conclusion space exploration essential 
stop poverty hunger satellites 
money budget 
better technology medicine 
space exploration thing 
like spending money space good money earth going space like happening planet 
money people need like hungry people need food 
like save money schools earth cleaner good money space stuff earth like food land crop 
earth getting poluted burning fossil like 
spend money earth like clean money space predicted happened tell weathers 
space exploration people think support space exploration people think problems earth explore space 
think spend national defence space exploration 
reason think spend money national defence spend billion dollars rarely attacked 
gave funding space travel discover planet like 
right technology lets land rover mars 
space program gets funding travel galaxy light years away 
discovering technology scientist invent machine benefit explorations 
scientist invented better fitness machines airplanes better weather forecasting 
people launching rockets cause polutions 
americans living poverty spend space exploration money helping 
spend money funding alternative fuel instead fossil fuel 
fossil fuel destroys planet harming breathe oceans

passage question consider talks going space waste money money save lives tangible benefits space exploration talks cost traveling space 
budget space exploration helps improve human intelegence 
agree question consider cornucopia reasons 
kids families suffering starvation poverty spending billion dollars going outer space 
point money spared little children families dying starvation 
secondly space travel good 
mean cool space dont think government spending billion dollars 
problems united states 
oponent differently 
oponent spending budget space travel united states huge dept spending money going outer space 
conclusion agree question consider 
women children dying starvation spending billion dollars going space 
needs stop 
space exploration worth worth cost 
think government billions money share 
people alot money 
poor afford food medical supplies 
people sick diseases 
lots people argue billion alot money 
government billion 
money taxes 
gain money wasted 
billion education 
second people providing inventions 
spirt space exploration helps remain creative healthy society 
progress solving hard difficult problems 
setting challenging goals inspire work 
people explore space money seen people space 
costs billion dollars people need help earth government send people space astronauts help discover things space help people earth 
example 'space race significant investment progress american education 
help america improve education 
nasa allow astronauts space monitor health 
people learning stress human body 
help astronauts safe harsh conditions launching space returning earth 
helped nasa improve airplanes exercise machines better weather forecasting 
sattliter space help monitor land soil crop rainfall drought 
people improve distributing food countries 
government send astronauts space discover help people earth 
think people space funds anymore 
like president eisenhower said rocket fired theft citizen suffered hunger poverty 
meal 
tons people probably months 
half americans difficulties paying housing food medicine 
surely ones going space families earning hard time funding jobs kids harder 
throwing money space 
government spends billion dollars year space exploration 
space explorations argue billion 
america poor billion dollars people going space 
imagine billion dollars 
american better place 
nasa spending money things need daily based 
need spending money useful instead stupid like nasa 
argue nasa elemenated society 
reason nasa 
poluting 
taken billion dollars like lift billion dollars going shelter help homeless people poverty 
pollution space ship making earth harmful live 
2020 earth gunna polluted gunna able live 
space 
think fund space exploration 
reason think fund space exploration scientist doctors learn stress astronauts space 
astronauts went missions scientist monitor health harsh conditions 
developed medical things/machines 
doctors learned human body goes threw stree 
doctors developed medicines people strees 
second reason space exploration helping earth 
people problems food 
help fund space exploration money need help need help need family 
helping space exploration help problems earth 
reason motavating benefical competition nations 
people want fight nations bomb-dropping 
space exploration helps competing nations bombs explotions 
astronauts compete moon sort planets 
achieve technologies achievments 
thanks space race progress american educations 
improved math science 
look outward space life changing earth 
money help people improve thing earth 
build houses homeless people money start life 
money save life hospital places 
help improve technology 
example ipads student need carry heave books stuff 
animals build houses food vitamins 
help people lives africa suffuring malaria 
large nets 
place water food medicine 
fund space exploration 
space exploration hurt lives 
affects rocket fired 
everytime rocket fired theft citizens suffering hunger poverty 
space exploration uses alot money float space 
instead money thing like innovating technology help ones need ones starving dying diseases cure/ people dying earth decaying slowly pollution 
harming oceans 
instead billion space exploration newer energy power heal people diseases cure safer cure people 
power energy powering transportation cars homes factories building 
money education making schools 
kids learn know 
money learning supplies resources books learn 
surprisingly author convince 
spend money space exploration spend 
people argue 
exactly selfish greedy people 
author noticed gave reasons space exploration important instead useless 
sure money things like education hunger poverty desperate things 
different point view 
chopped number national defense billion 26.3 national budget 
space exploration money considered 
national defense larger number exploration space considered 
like author said space exploration competition different nations 
need useless idiotic things like national defense 
national defense anyways 
attacking 
nations competed harmless things like explores space people live longer life earth benefit 
satellites circling earth monitor land improving people distribute food 
improvement glad mentioned writer 
immediately reeled strongly opinion budge 
hunger poverty problem anymore focus tracking conditions drought rain soil 
greatest problems finally finally fall 
disagree author claim space exploration desirable needs earth 
problems earth need adressed going space explorations 
problems earth solved 
problems people poverty fossil fuels damage environment diseases spread stopped lacks proper funding 
lots people poverty afford things medicine food housing 
diseases like malaria stopped putting nets beds people affected malaria afford nets 
poverty causes people able nets 
fossil fuels damage environment earth 
money space exploration help solutions problems earth 
funding space exploration stopped money help poor forms enerrgy 
space exploration happen problems earth 
ahve given reasons going author claim space exploration desirable needs earth 
stop funding space exploration 
author convince 'space exploration desirable needs earth 
author gave good reasons think space explorations desirable right diseases disasters happenning right 
author puts people world dying 
article states space explorations help earth better seeing places having droughts pollution 
helping 
looking 
change 
article author states stuff space earth 
author says humans getting hurt earth getting hurt 
t/hese reasons author convince 
think punrurt space food precd 
maybe money need like gong need money know 
reading article believe space exploration important helps earth figure things 
example nasa scientists developed innovations ideas products including better airplanes better weather forecasting better excercise machines 
improvements things improved lives resulted technologies nasa engineers developed space traveling possible 
example problems hunger poverty tackled space exploration 
satellites circle earth measure track conditions soil rainfall crops droughts stuff 
informations people improve produce contribute food 
finally space exploration important motivate beneficial competitions amoung nations 
example united states russia competed prove greatness race explore space 
wanted ones visit planets land spacecraft moon 
reasons believe space exploration important funded 
support space travel deffensive criticized 
essay pretty persuasive little bland admit alittle cliche 
reason poverty global warming little 
author persuade 
reasons space travel help 
honest actually think money space travel helping earth actually help 
maybe little long 
personally think humans change ways better earth better 
mean time space travel help look home case 
applies poverty sick people fund forever 
mean billion dollars money people need help think billion dollars cover 
money space travel 
money funding hungry 
knows billion dollars billion funding 
sorry grammer 
good essay peices evidence 
real setting education aside essay know essay meant educational purpose like said deffensive 
step step think fund space exploration 
earth problem worry space 
problems like global warming pollution limit resources 
clean earth cleanse 
worry earth explore space 
believe solve cure problems earth 
sickness pollution global warming lack food wars lack resources 
problems solve think space solve problems 
solve problems earth explore hearts content 
like test solve question 
people space exploration help solve problems 
space exploration improve medicine science math technology 
example moon achieve improve technology medicine stuff like rocket need ensure health astronaut 
medicine technology discover earth 
help improve life style health 
thing problem second problem second 
solve earth problems explore space ease 
explore freely knowing problem earth 
live pollution global warming food 
explore steady environment 
think fund space exploration reasons 
money spent space exploration little compared national budget 
second nasa space program improved earth technology 
space education spends national government budget 
rest budget spend education national defense renewable energy 
space education government budget 
nasa space program builds designs technology space space start planets word definition 
earth technology improved nasa 
opposing space education effects earth people 
adds global warming pollution 
fossil fuels burned space rockets launch adds pollution earth 
think money space education help poor/poverty 
poor money place live hunger dehydration mosquito bites 
government funds space education better technology future 
author article convince space exploration desirable 
reasons need space exploration ways study astronomy spending money better things 
space exploration need merely want 
better things world study like medication disease 
reality needs know space space 
need spending billion dollars year space exploration ways observe things space 
telescope instead wasting billion dollars year 
spending money better things like disease medicine 
budget thats billion dollars 
billion 
billion spending education people country 
believe space exploration waste money 
throwing cash away like fools instead lets smart change focus instead universe 
think space exploration desirable things earth 
money spent space exploration improve people lives 
instead wasting billion dollars looking help people poverty 
million americans live poverty scientist long looking stars 
people suffering money 
instance instead spending billion space help 3,800,000,000 people africa threatened malaria 
prevents malaria costs save lives billion people 
like president eisenhower said rocket fired theft citizens suffored hunger poverty 
people need help earth 
suffering pollution harming oceans 
need forms cleaner energy power cars factories homes 
useful worthy invest program helps planet people 
think fund space exploration 
needs earth 
space exploration costs 
author said budget space exploration billion dollars national budget think 
good billion dollars 
money going food medical care people need 
people year starvation diseases help number money space exploration 
author mentions satallites circle earth monitor lands help distribute food 
think people knew want distribute 
need spending billion dollars learn human body reaction stress 
feel space exploration worth immediate investment significant benefits people 
needs earth innovation space travel problem potential solutions lead solutions 
cost people barely significant compared extremely effensive military spending expenditure especially state actively waging 
spending totals quarter united states budget like stealing people compared mittances allocated education space travel 
resulting technological innovations obvious affect costs medical technological advances space program improved quality life 
innovations conjunction discoveries 
potential eliminate ailments society famine dehabilitating disease oppressment people 
couple redirection military spending poor aflicted given better services care simple tools improve quality life 
military severe drain country resources 
granted military need large higher priorities warfare 
times shown diverting resources space exploration prevents need military spending major countries actually focusing warfare 
concentrate efforts exploration lesser issue 
environment concern raised 
funding cleaner accessable fuel sources innovations help alleviate problem opening options fueling space craft 
reduce military spending join efforts demilitarized countries produce advances fields science continuing exploration benefitting people 
author article conviced earth danger government spend money renewable energy instead spending money space defense 
spends money defense like billion dollars 
billion dollars renewable energy people energy burning fossil fuels harming earth 
think money exploring space bombs useless help community kill people 
money heling people sick diease 
think nasa space exploration useful study space 
people africa dying malaria disease caused mosquitos 
people africa money nets cost 
people world spend money hospitals technology help renewable energy 
people money space defense country state 
think america funding space explorations 
space explorations help things

spend billion dollers cause look rock need money help thoose people thier maleria stuff need money cause 46.2 million people live poverty nearly half 
americans housing food medicca 
convinced personally love airplanes technology nasa create planes weather forcasting 
becasue space race happening 1960 u.s. moon helped 
education math science needed skills want good 
maybe start space exploration modivate says modivates farther space 
reason space exploration uses billion dollars sounds like alot money compared billion military little 
helps humans start space program doctors measure human body react stressful events like launch rocket crushing sensationis felt propeled gravity 
finally perconally think pictures satlites orbit stars outstanding beautiful 
space exploration difficult topic 
people think good idea disagree different reasons 
americans live proverty 
nasa builds rockets satelights costs lots money spent improving homes food disease 
spending money helping polution like problem 
space stations argue acctually spend money think cent counts 
argue helped improve lives better airplanes exercise machines weather forcasting

rocket electronic 
camras send person agian 
saying know people suffering lack food home barely money want money kind worth convincing 
agree exploring space important saving earth people suffering starvation 
agree like said population poverty explor space like having earth important situation polution 
truthfully think trying space 
feel instead speading billions dollars space days save money 
money space different countries poverty 
think solving problems space truthfully 
46.2 million american living poverty 
think america great nearly half america afford food housing health care 
think intill stop problems like hunger homeless people think going space 
adding flame 
earth suffering

imagines send help countries poor 
instead invade countries 
government greedy blames space exploration wasting money helping earth distributing reasources 
money detences military solved 
lets different point view 
space exploration funded billion dollars 
alot right 
wrong 
national budget 
billion spent renewable energy

true thing going earth thing bodes planet space think good 
space 
article convince space travel important 
important things funding earth spending billions dollars going space 
sure space interesting like learn 
important problems earth space 
instance malaria huge problem africa 
people need protect hang sleep 
afford 
think launching people space waist money 
people spend billion dollars letting group people moon hundreds thousands people dying 
shooting rockets harming 
artical mentions space exploration helps remain creative society 
creative society earth instead flying money space 
overall argument think space exploration important 
opinion author convince fund space exploration 
think benefited space exploration 
news satelites space 
weather reports satelites space 
like auther stated national budget space exporation 
little compared 26.3 national budget uses national defense 
sure problems earth solve people helping improve 
like africa people doneting nets protect people catching melaria 
conclude people working solve problems earth 
national budget goes space exploration 
benefits space satellites 
space exploration funded 
essay importance space exploration author talks pros cons space exploration 
author asks question space exploration desirable needs earth 
think space exploration desirable things need taken care earth 
believe space exploration important helped scientific knowledge past think future

fact space exploration benefits cause 
essay states satellites monitor crops soil rainfall drought 
useful tool help solve world hunger 
believe space exploration important 
think important argument actually benefitted space exploration 
helps improve modern technology scientific knowledge 
want robbed scientific knowledge chance solving world hunger space exploration shut 
convince 
think space 
people dying malaria white nasa spending time money going space 
instead nasa money large nets lots people cost dollars spend money planet form energy 
reading belief space 
thought space final frontier cool 
authors counterargument worked 
sure gave arguements space matters facts begining stick 
46.2 million people poverty 
read longer believe space 
lets start poverty 
mentioned couple sentences 46.2 million people poverty 
spending billion sending people uninhabited worlds bring rocks 
scientists fuss tons things dont affect 46.2 million people 
mars water great people learning healthy housed clothed 
water maters exists people dont water 
earth 
live planet inhabitable 
destroy dead space useless 
author says fossil fuels harming 
guess fuels rockets partly fossil fuel 
mention gasses released takeoff 
intill rockets renewable sources technology 
wreck space useless 
lets money billion space 
billion 19,000,000,000 spent sending tubes metal avoid rocks 
sure rocks cancer cures food everybody 
money funding education food instead spend rocks 
know feeding teaching children important magical space rocks 
kill earth starve refuse teach couple rockets wont difference 
need focus matters planet barren ones 
lets solve problems leave planet 
fund space exploration national budget like paragraphs said 
plus space exploration actually helping people earth 
example astronauts allowed missions scientists ways monitor health stressful conditions 
medical instruments developed doctors learned human body reaction stress 
tangible benefits space exploration 
paragraph reasons fund space exploration reasons fund 
pretty sure scientists astronauts seen 
nineteen billion dollars stuff 
example people dying access clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
importance space exploration 
paragraph convinced space exploration funded 
believe helped people things past sure help 
plus wonder 
mean probably seen watch grow 
like worms mars maybe living things 
know astronauts explore 
addition nation budget space exploration 26.3 national defense education 
tangible benefits space exploration 
paragraph adds people needs 
like said space exploration actually helped people medical needs 
nasa astronauts missions people died stress 
space exploration important motivate beneficial competion nations 
imagine human suffering avoided nations competed planet exploring spaceships instead bomb-dropping planes 
space place filled mystery darkness 
gave universe explore home earth 
believe explore things instead seeing thing everyday 
believe explore space plethora reasons 
alot reasources rate going 
finding soulution trying alternative planet 
million dallers spent exploring space billion dallers spent national defence 
destroys planet tanks bombs resources work hard soultion global warming time bombs tanks destroyed earth 
finding alternative solution planet smarter effective solution 
secound teacher tells students learn things stop learning 
space fasanating 
children dreamed venturing 
away bomb enemies correct choice 
people argue going space wastes money stated national defence uses billion dollers 
times money spent space 
inconclusion worried world hunger poverty states secound paragraph president eisenhower thinks venturing space idea opposed space program saying rocket fired theft citizens suffered 
hunger poverty 
believe bomb dropped theft citizens suffer hunger poverty 
believe national defence allowence space finances 
pushes nations compeate sence science 
nations compeat ways science things discovered russia united states compeated moon 
affected world good article suggests resulted technologies mentioned

based text think space exploration desirable things need earth 
think government needs spend billion dollars year space exploration desirable government needs focused people 
people lost lives money afford medical care clean water 
space exploration desirbale people lossing lives important spend money year 
convince 
people africa think important 
mosquito sleep 
cost cover sleep 
bitten 
afford disease spreading people suffering 
reason think space exploration desirable pollution burning fossils fuels harming ocean pollution gasoline 
pollution maybe harming earth chemicals gasoline good inhale 
reason government spending money space exploration problems hunger poverty messed space exploration

like space exploration 
takes money 
peoples lives improved money loss 
space exploration slightly killing 
killing earth 
burning fossil fuels destroying planet 
harms oceans 
alot people having difficulty paying food medicine housing 
africa people malaria 
nets bought lower spread disease 
people afford 
exploration takes money 
small chance finding 
fund space exploration 
space help good thing people africa money protect 
american half people hard time paying housing food medicine

cost 
cost 
mosquito bites disease spread stop mosquito biting people 
american hard time 
half american hard time paying housing food medicine 
africa american suffer 
earth suffer countries suffer 
countries dont access water medical care simple solutions money need space exploration 
reason billions money space exploration 
save money people needed money 
think fund space exploration money fund space exploration things 
people earth need money cause stated second paragraph article 42.5million people live poverty looking food money survive 
paragraph article saids billion dollars spent space exploration money reduce great percentage people living poverty 
money fund space exploration help countries need money like africa malaria disease mosquito bites happens africa 
deaths happen africa simple cost dollars spread affected disease 
people afford cause money 
population happening world cause people like gases loitering caused population global warming world 
fund space exploration nasa money time safe eco-friendly ways powering things stoping food loitering 
money protect selves money prevent possible distares 
money fund space exploration stoped fund america countries better ways things 
position fund space exploration stop funding money 
space exploration satties look droughts floods reduces damages earth 
instead bomb dropping plains fight space ferma stalites space space problems earth stattlight space beanth earth looking problems fixing 
think space exploration good think 
understand satelites good seeing world circumstance single picture passage says great importance sending mars 
glory pride bragging rights 
need glory pride bragging rights 
having satelite droutes fires floods natural disasters like good 
think knowing things like happening deal good 
small step space technology actually helps mankind world 
like satelites support getting moon world 
single country appreciate having american woman land moon mars world bigger country 
famished people africa poor people india spend money feed family 
u.s.a. putting human mars moon 
need look world bigger picture 
world country domination 
love world love people 
love born children syria bombed 
love people help instead raisin pride domination earn putting human mars moon 
reasons think space exploration good overdone 
opinion think space exploration desirable 
think pros space exploration outweigh cons given innovations stuff protest space exploration 
pros outweigh cons 
passage listed cons 
space exploration uses money spent things fuel burns damaging earth 
cons 
passage mentions pros 
example benefits area medicine stuff space exploration improved technology better weather forcasting 
mention pros cons 
second space explorations came ideas help lives 
mentioned 
bigger things helped 
like space exploration given motivation bigger better things 
countries space exploration settle disputes 
like passage mentions united states russia 
instead going fighting settled space race 
space exploration 
finally space exploration 
course cost money compared things americans compare farms factories 
think slowly changing fuel harmful 
know right wrong saying space exploration 
think space exploration desirable 
stated opinions think 
believe exploring space good idea earth needs money support humans animals diseases 
earth suffering money need decreasing rockets 
true earth needs funding rockets people earth difficulties needs taken care 
traveling space rockets help people earth problems 
funding rockets earth suffer 
hearing government spending billion rockets year space exploration unbelievable smart 
earth suffering pollution kills animals environment decreasing choice meals 
environment needs help animals greens daily lives 
spending money space exploration like killing people 
earth needs money planning explore space 
think people sent space 
space exploration helpful thing 
space exploration helpful better medicines 
science technology school soviet racing space 
better airplanes 
space explorations asissted different ways 
billion dollars space exploration 
world bunch problems right example countries clean water money help 
think help world problems right instead going space 
space exploration going space helps world fine 
matter preference 
believe fund space exploration good care planet 
example planet decided populate care able good care 
reason believe 
waste money space program need things earth 
author convinced author gave problems money medical care hunger poverty earth gave solution space exoploration pretty convincing 
solutions money 
people billion dollars spend space exploration spend education space exploration space exploration thing metals upgrade machines 
endless things 
second solution medical care 
scientists machines 
think nasa costs money continue funding continue space exploration earth alot problems needs dealt like example disease called malaria spreads mosquito bites africa 
people live africa needs nets mosquitos away cost dollars people live africa afford 
nasa funded anyways fuel rocket uses affecting ocean 
makes harder breath makes ocean clean drink 
nasa funded cost like billions dollars launch rocket space satellite 
makes people lose jobs home funding space program able support anymore 
think space exploration desirable needs earth 
money people poverty right 
ones need money dying 
like president eisenhower said rocket fired like theft citizens suffering hunger poverty 
americans living poverty nearly half difficulty paying things need survive life 
people countries suffering having clean water medical care simple things prevent diseases 
example people africa dollar prevent malaria 
people need help earth needs help 
need cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories pollution harming ocean right 
billion dollars spent space exploration 
national budget difference 
money help people earth instead 
opinion exploring space desirable need help earth 
problems earth poverty pollution diseases people need help need money spend exploring space 
exploring space beneficial having nasa engineers modify airplanes improve weather forecasting inventing technologies 
exploring outer space money help problems earth 
important reason need help people diseases scientists need money able cures 
polluted 
order problem need money renewable clean energy 
people homeless create shelters money 
problems earth money space 
money exploration space help humans discovering 
having money explore space nasa focus space invent creations modify 
ways airplanes safety better predicting forecast

think earth like space exploration 
feel people earth important need spend money space 
need know things like stars involve 
feel saving people poverty better exploring space 
think nasa space comanies study things subjects benifit people earth 
example explore planet galaxy survive 
wasting money exploring stars useful 
americans living proverty 
save money fundraising space 
people afford cost 
protect malaria 
disease mosqitos 
overall space important people earth needs money 
ideas beetwen expensive time necesary need information moon 
bing thing article need mars rove

wont able actully interesting space ship gone moon space 
thee cons expensive time consuming 
money nasa spending given poor hungry bumbs homeless 
time homeless bumbs dint study school nasas foult bumy 
money people africa becuse mosquitos malaria aint tryna 
conclud sure 
spending money need 
invent help space people 
instead spending billion dollars space invention help people need 
like 
help people homeless help people indanged 
help people africa needs help/buy mosquito nets 
spend money endangered animals 
help clean earth money 
spending billion dollars space

people africa killed disease mosquitos spread malaria 
possible stop disease hanging large nets beds protect people bitten 
nets people africa afford 
people earth live poverty 
people spending money space exploration money donated poor 
mean life people dieing world access clean water medical care simple solution prevent spread disease 
cares space exploration care poor 
donating money stop stealing valuable stuff stores people 
space exploration break people world living poverty 
launching uses lots fossil fuel means right poluting earth 
polutions cause things 
leak fossil fuels ocean kill creatures 
years fish caught decreased 
fish dieing reproduce ones died 
keeps fish extinct future 
money lots things 
example donate farmers crops building sturdy bridges callapse earthquake donate money hospital help people earth 
waste money space exploration 
people right earth living poverty 
stop people dieing living poverty 
stop space exploration money better things plus causes pollution causes global warming 
melts artic create level flood cities 
people stop space exploration 
improvents people live 
1953 president eisenhower captured viewpoint 
46.2 million americans live poverty

money spent like money spend military 
space exploration relevant future sure life step right time 
benefits space exploration created today 
benefits space exploration greatly exceed cost 
national budget compared 26.3 military purposes 
know security country highest priority things 26.3 budget obscene 
tiny money fighting poverty creating clean energy leaving impact security 
allies major countries right need military power people opposing weaker 
explore outer space expanding boundary knowledge planets solar systems galaxies inhabit 
education discovery things different exploring rest studying science 
long believe worth investment resources uses 
finally space exploration benefitted greatly 
different life today satellites power phones internet single 
important things direct result space exploration important 
reasons believe benefits space explorations greatly outweigh cost

like story 
think people need space cleaner cars homes 
earth human people space 
people think government spends money space exploration 
maybe people think billion dollars year 
think spend money education world problems spend money space exploration country country poverty 
space exploration possibly money taxes 
taxes raise making harder thing need 
taxes gets higher people bankrupt harder live america 
people space exploration lead invention help world problem 
nations compete invention world problems 
cause example cold 
russia america competed land spacecraft moon 
countries competed greatness wealth space exploration 
cause world problems 
space exploration people think spend money education students graduate college university 
students help space exploration 
think wait better education 
better education students graduating solve problems like porverty percentage poverty caused kids dropping school 
think money space exploration 
education world problems possibly help space exploration later

author good point space exploration think earth needs instead space exploration 
billion dollars goes space exploration going helping poverty- stricken countries 
america debt anyways 
mentioned eariler hurting earth majorly 
think space travel humans discovered healthier launch rockets 
space travel workout machines weather forcasting airplanes better 
americans lazy exercising machines anyways 
think weather forcasting fine

think government fund space exploration takes money away people living poverty struggling housing food medicine 
countries people different kinds diseases dont money medicine treatment help pain away 
reason think funding shouldnt space exploration hurt citizens hurt environment 
bunch scientist believe burning fossil fuels gasoline oils pollute oceans chemicals 
pollution burning fossil fuels harm animals 
chemicals floating oceans kill animals turtles dolphis seals fish whales 
pollution kill humans inside lung cause respitory problem lung canceer asthma broncitous second hand smoke 
thte 19-billion spend space exploration year think money educational resources medical supplies cleaner forms energy power homes factories 
purspecive government fund space exploration 
space exploration humans feed hunger curiosity 
curiosity lures spending money people earth suffering poverty environmental problem 
author supported problems earth 
poverty earth needs eliminated 
people suffering hunger medical needs diseases 
billion dollars creating jobs food medicine cures maybe poverty vanguish earth 
instead humans money pullute earth feed selfish needs 
example year people dying malaria prevented hanging nets sleep 
costs people afford 
problem pollution earth caused burning and/or cutting trees fossil fuels 
burning weed fossil fuels creates energy release horrible element co2/ uses billion dollars invest cleaner energy produce carbon dioxide 
help earth clean 
space exploration heal people elimiate poverty global warming 
author supported idea money space exploration helping earth 
space exploration desirable desires aside earth 
explore space needs earth 
disadvantages benefits space-exploring 
think space-exploring stopping lots benefits stop

plus space exploration motivate beneficial competition nations 
opinion space exploration continue 
problems hunger poverty happening earth 
space exploration tackle stuffs 
example satellites circle earth lots land time 
observe measure conditions crops soil rainfall drought 
satellites 
people information improve grow food 
result problem hunger solved 
know grow food trades 
economy better better 
problem poverty solved 
space exploration deal problems hunger poverty 
text says example 1960 
called cold united states russia competed prove greatness race explore space 
instead competing bomb-dropping airplanes competing planet-exploring spaceships improve life conditions prevent 
nations focus inventing satellite occupied minds 
suggest continue space-exploration 
text 'the government spends billion dollars year space exploration 
people huge money help solve problem spend space-exploration

satellites travel earth measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
helps earth solve number problems 
piece evidence author provided investment space exploration especially worthwhile tangible benefits example area medicine 
think space trips people dieing hunger medica attasen case wast mony space helping people 
think waste money space exploration people need 
schools supplies maybe work places 
save people stravation provide freash water food 
reason disease bugs money horrid bugs hurting trying kill 
schools better houses

nasa uses billion dollars year actually cure solution help save human life 
wasted billion dollars years solution 
think space exploration right good idea 
people favor space exploration argue billion dollars 
billion considering billion government spends military billion education 
space exploration national budget definitly small 
space exploration good thing inspired medical workers develop machine monitored human stress level 
helped weater satellite monitor pieces earth land track best soil rainfall drought 
space exploration fund millions people infected malaria people inspired hard challenges help government fund raising 
idea going space visiting planets maybe species sound far-fetched nasa recently planet potentially hold human species 
like investment space exploration

cost space exploration billion dollars like actually little budget 
weve spend billion dollars defense space exploration 
space exploration help different ways 
author essay convinces funds space exploration 
main reasons funds space exploration 
reasons people suffering health problems pollutions harming ocean earth need help people like people africa suffering different diseases 
instance different bacteria carried mosquitoes people nets protect bite 
bitten kids mosquitoes medcines help spreading bacteria parts body 
afford buying medicine afford buying nets cured right away people start dying access clean water clean water need 
survive 
lead medical problems 
fact closest family member lead depression 
medication help cure money afford buying nets 
people africa problem 
problem pollution burning fossil fuels lead damages earth clean nice need survive 
plants animals need survive 
polluted plants going damage problem humans human need oxygen live plants produces oxygen 
plants animals start dying pollution 
pollution problem earth needs help 
earth major danger burning fossil fuel 
conclusion things need worry right instead funding space exploration 
fund earth humans trouble pollution dieases 
help fund people needs help 
fund space exploration 
think discover things aircraft flies space 
example nasa scientists figured moniter human body stressed 
nasa improved weather forecasting exercising machines better airplanes 
things improved thanks nasa technologies 
people favor billion u.s. dollars space exploration money 
earth cleaner non-poluted planet 
billion dollars alot 
billion dollars national budget 
money national defense 26.3 eduacation billion dollars clean renewable energy 
agree author 
funding space exploration lead important discoveries help people everyday lives 
satellites space monitor crop conditions 
help people change ways growing crops 
space funding stop funding important things earth 
think fund space exploration 
author definitely convince space exploration pursued issues earth need resolved 
question sparked debate government began pursue space travel 
opponents space exploration claim government spending assist citizens solve problems earth hunger poverty 
opinion reasons supporting space exploration outweigh claims 
united states annual space exploration funding amounts billion dollars mere percent nation yearly budjet 
contrast percent spent defense military 
surely increasing budjet space program dire effects 
fact multiple reasons higher spending space exploration positive effects 
reason development innovative technology 
innovations created developed space program uses daily lives millions 
example effective exercise machines weather prediction technologies created space program common parts lives 
furthermore space exploration able help solve issues face earth 
instance satellites placed earth orbit able provide detailed information weather crop-growing conditions inform agricultural practices 
reason continue space exploration spark constructive competition nations 
push countries develop technologies turn benefit millions billions people 
period competition russia known space race serves example concept 
conclusion controversy halted space exploration believe reasons presented prove space exploration beneficial continued 
space exploration desirable needs earth 
article question convinced space exploration desirable problems 
investment space exploration continue cost small compared investments benefits area medicine helps hunger poverty 
cost space exploration billion dollars 
total national budget 
compared investments small compared billion dollars spent military fourth total national budget 
according nasa organization charge space program discoveries human body ensuring safety astronauts 
satellites circle earth monitor condition crops soil rainfall drought 
conclusion space exploration desirable problems earth 
investment space exploration continue cost small compared investments benefits area medicine helps hunger poverty 
space exploration useless right earth 
people need right instead shoot rockets space wasting millions 
money stop problems earth like malaria 
malaria disease spread mosquito bites 
dollars nets beds lower spread disease dollars 
waste billion dollars space exploration money buying nets lower spread malaria 
problem poverty americans poverty right 
americans live poverty lower money space exploration improve people lives 
americans having trouble paying taxes food medicine 
countries people dying money clean water medical care cures diseases 
like malaria afford dollar nets good reason fund space exploration 
people stop funding space exploration 
article states things going earth money explore space 
people stop funding space exploration 
article states people sick money medications 
countries people having access clean water medical care 
supporting article earth suffering pollution 
scientists believe gasoline harming oceans 
need cleaner forms energy power cars homes factories 
argument people funding space exploration people funding space exploration claim billion dollars 
people stop funding space exploration money important 
think people fund space exploration 
author convinced space exploration funded 
feel think positives outweigh negatives 
expenses united states money anyways 
space travel funded chance better technology invented 
example weather news internet accurate airplanes invented 
additionally satellite space earth help solve hunger poverty problem satellites sharing information collect space 
countries know distribute food people people stay alive 
funding space exploration helping intellectual curiosity 
humans wonder space people answer 
space exploration funded maybe answer share humans finally stop asking question 
addition quality medicine increased advancement space travel 
space challenging scientists produce medicine help astronauts survive space 
medical tools developed control stress levels doctors know stress levels 
doctors help patients suffering stress 
reason fund space travel motivates countries beneficial competition instead violence 
instead bombs nuclear weapons countries competitions exploration solar 
information gathered countries 
conclusion reasons space travel funded 
benefit knowledge earth 
author convince space exploration desirable 
reasons convince author told americans live poverty 
point money going space exploration money building houses planting crops 
money spent basic needs help people poverty 
reason author convince space exploration takes fossil fuels uses 
happens earth ozone layer continue worse 
means spend money earth continue produce carbon dioxide cause oxygen 
lead polluted earth getting heated earth heats harder normal things usual 
hurt have/making food means people hungry hungry long lead higher death rates 
mean drastic change temprature heat places flood homes belong humans/animals/and plants 
cause species penguins polar bears endangered species worse extinct 
lastly author convince people dying 
people people africa dying malaria afford protect 
author states space exploration important earth 
author states nearly half americans live poverty 
disagree author people earth need money order stay healthy 
spending money space exploration people need desperately needs clean water food medicine need 
earth suffering causing humans suffer 
money earth better place 
instead rocketships space gaze stars moon 
people need places important space travel waste money money earth better planet stay 
people think researching space 
things space

nasa help developed useful medical instrument learn human body react certain things 
believe space exploration contribute develop technology making life little easier 
space exploration useful helpful earth 
informs scientist going earth need earth clean 
despite good cause space exploration people helpful believed government wasting money billion things necessarily needed 
people said instead wasting money space exploration help 46.2 millions american lives poverty 
billion help people dying hunger preventable disease like malaria afford cost 
believed earth affected action 
scientists believe pollution burning fossil fuel gasoline starting harm oceans 
believe space exploration helped provide invention prevent uncurable disease 
discover better technologies better scientific knowledge 
example 1960 'cold united states russia competed prove greatness race explore space strive land spacecraft moon planet 
achieved significant investment progress american education 
space exploration benefits 
believe billion worth discoveries past years 
fact billion space exploration national budget 
help track condition earth undergoing 
nasa developing innovation help lives improve 
includes better machines huge help factories better airplane help land safely fastly provide better weather forecast help know accurate estimation 
aware thing prepared 
sattelites monitor earth land problem harm environment 
avoid human suffering instead bomb-dropping airplanes planet exploring spaceship 
believe space exploration worth fund 
government willing help poverty able help 
space exploration helpful environment 
think good idea fund space exploration 
think good idea 
affects people earth helpful 
space exploration funded 
space exploration funded reasons 
funded 46.2 billion americans live proverty money exploration coud help people 
secondly earth suffering program develop clean energy worthy investment 
thirdly diseases like malaria need money help diseases 
people agree fund space exploration 
leads tangible benefits 
thing exploration discoveries years people earth helped 
conclusion space exploration funded waste money 
money help people earth 
fund space exploration pick 
believe providing money space exploration different needs needed earth 
believe save money homeless public schools people work hours paid little like teachers 
maybe economy current position money waste space exploration 
justify claim 46.2 million americans poverty americans trouble paying food medicine housing 
world dying acess fresh water medicine food 
money improve environment 
example cars motors factories polluting 
disagree 
argue money alot 
makes creative society 
true 
billion dollars dept space race government billion dollars improve math science 
believe change 
change going space explorations saved money helped need 
reading article convinced space exploration needed funded 
example billion dollars national budget space exploration started nasa scientists developed 020020554her innovations improve life better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting 
paragraph question consider true people dying easily prevented diseases malaria 
space exploration possible help satellites government country needs help prevent simple diseases like malaria 
paragraph question consider said earth uses fossil fuel daily life 
earth runs fossil fuel 
likely people thought space exploration costed fund 
earth surive till suns expands giant earth minutes space exploration humans created space station cities human live human race surive 
conclusion think space exploration nessary needed humans better future 
going explore space spend money 
maybe save people poverty kids expirienced life education 
actually like stuff traveling space hurt 
fuels burn atmosphere rocket 
think people consideration 
reasons showing focus stuff important stuff dont need know 
like people africa dieing cause afford nets afford 5,000,000 stuff nasa 
help people lives going space 
need focused happening word outside 
like says article explore goes inspace focus needed world

africa people dying malaria afford sending people space billion dollars 
people favor space exploration send people space track measure condition crops help grow food 
completely disagree think instead sending people space solve hunger problems root problem solve 
save million dollars nets people africa 
dying malaria 
thing space exploration burns fossil fuels burns environment harming planets animals 
want person malaria 
stop sending people space instead spend money food medicine poor 
space exploration needed people suffering 
lots benefits author mentioned space exploration 
author mentioned space exploration help earth 
satellites monitor earth 
track crops rainfall droughts soil

people favor space exploration tangible benefits come space exploration 
personally think continue space exploration 
firstly continue space exploration tangible benefits medicine 
ways monitor health stressful conditions 
better exercise machines better airplanes better weather forecasting came technologies nasa engineers developed space travel possible 
despite costs billion dollars disagree spends million national defense year 
problems hunger poverty tackled space exploration 
satellites track measure condition crops soil rainfall drought 
people earth information improve produce distribute food 
money invested space exploration instead develop program clean energy 
disagree billion dollars year renewable clean energy

people countries dying need 'clean water medical care simple solutions prevent spread diseases 
people countries afford medicine food 
money spent space exploring people better life 
reason space exploration desirable people need help earth 
'many scientists believe pollution burning fossil fuels like gasoline harming oceans 
means people need aware going help build solution money people think going waste 
reasons maintain position space exploration desirable needs earth 
think people explore space 
america familys proverty hunger 
gives information weather crops need focuse people weathe like tomorrow 
think spending million dollers going space instead saving lives 
africa people dying malaria instead speanding million dollers nets spend going space 
nets costs dollers imagene nets 
save life thats better going space 
like countries need spend million dollers going space like ignoring 
are'nt spending money schools 
schools money 
instead buying supplies giving money space 
1960 america russia went space race 
better spent million dollers russia america better 
figure going fixing space ship 
understand going spae lead discoveries planet hold walking moon people proverty proverty 
great discover mars sustainable life right 
reasons space 
space exploration 
think problems earth money 
waste billion dollars total national budget space exploration matter space 
think waste billion dollars year space exploration 
problems earth poverty clean water starvation homelessness half america trouble paying housing 
useful things like saving people lives paying space 
dollars billion save person life malaria 
opinion subject simple money space exploration people earth struggling rent dying hunger diseases 
human beings important planets stars 
author reason 
money spent education going space think education important 
author space 
author good 
shows space 
instead money heal people earth 
fund space exploration earth 
believe time money energy building spaceships instead fighting poverty finding clean energy sources 
thought pace exploration worth attention space exploration world technologies developed 
opinion think continue support space program 
said world 
space explorations things maybe develop technology making afford minerals useful technologies 
stand chance finding habitable planet 
chances overpopulation starving lessened 
people disagree point building spaceships looking habitable planets lots time technology millions starving dying people africa getting help 
attend people poverty exploring space 
start looking planets 
entire u.s. national budget spent space programs 
money taken space programs 
afford wait satellites fall lose specially trained people fund 
millions people poverty years simply wait long 
said money charity font taken space program u.s. yearly national money spent space programs 
shocking money going military year attacked anymore 
need standing army spend hundreds thousands dollars soldier year 
addition chance attacked space race countries happening attention 
happens competition building spaceships launching advantage 
wars technological advances bound happen 
u.s. russia 1960s 
called cold 
resulted improved exercise machines advanced aircraft accurate weather forecasting 
similar renaissance 
rediscovering 
space race help creative curious society 
opposers human lives stull worthy attention space programs 
matter people poverty getting attention 
agree believe space programs money 
space programs helping poor people chance improving lives billions people poverty technological advances 
addition space programs helping poverty 
space programs launched satellites satellites tell people people need food people wasting time looking person 
point help people poverty shouldnt money space program 
money spared unneccassarily huge budget going military 
habitable planets possibly food space resources achieved space programs 
space exploration result technological advances especially space races 
addition fighting attention space race 
satellites launched space programs save time lives telling people poor people need food medical attention 
think shouldnt space becuase people america 
continue spend money nasa 
ones earn money 
special materials 
better 
ingredint cooking business countries 
spent nasa shut 
like scientist working important leave 
fair 
look billion dollars 
useless national defense billion 
need defense free country 
national defense help people need 
people need stronger build schools smarter national defense 
think exploring space 
live moon humans know clean trash trash cans 
sure space travel benfitted society thought maybe help people 
like airplanes experiments nasa ways launch space ship 
money spent space travel instead help people need 
explore space help people dying disease type illness 
billion dollars space 
space travel provided good things wait years planet matures healthy world 
space travel worth lives millions 
space exploration desirable helps things need earth 
money fund space exploration 
true people africa diagnosed diseases like malaria wrong feel economy budget united states problem 
invest space exploration help malaria diseases 
billion alot compared billion going national 
wars space exploration 
items author included understandable 
education needs money finding clean energy important 
space exploration important item country needs waste time people thing 
sound little fetched killed mother earth late save 
maybe nice idea planet live 
long zone galaxies galaxies away 
zone planets average temperature earth scientist think hold water 
achievements space exploration stop 
technology getting better better technology research space research help better earth 
space exploration waste time desirable 
fund space exploration author convinced fund space exploration 
long-term benefits society explore space 
total national budget conditions weather crops soil monitored motivates beneficial competition nations innovations improved lives thanks space exploration 
nasa allowed astronauts missions cure help doctors learn human body reaction stress 
space exploration astronauts experience stress launch return leave area medicine date 
better exercise machines airplanes weather forecasting developed nasa scientist advance technologies needed space travel 
reason fund space exploration hunger poverty dealed space exploration 
satellites monitor measure conditions crops soil weather information improve food produce 
important reason space exploration important encourages competition countries 
reduced warfare countries 
example 1960 russia competed land spacecraft moon visit planets 
lead alot technologies advancement today 
space race 'leads better science mathe education needed compete races 
conclusion think fund space exploration important think 
improved study medicine encourage competition nation better ways farm long term benefit invest 
space exploration necessary thing greatly effects country 
exploration important learning maybe incoming asteroids left earth 
solutions stopping space exploration short cure help treat diseases earth 
cancelled space mission families malaria nets 
send explorations earth helping farm supply small malnourished villages 
money send education curing diseases world 
money wars space explorations impovrished countrys great impact lose process 
important space exploration curing lending helping hand people improve important stars moons
